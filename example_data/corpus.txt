# 20th Century.md


Erasure was always present, but its effects on human civilization accelerated rapidly in the 20th century.

Erasure began appearing during the 19th century in small bursts, slowly increasing in severity. While this caused disruption, particularly to European imperialism, it was manageable until the first major Erasure disaster. The first major Erasure Disaster occurred in Europe, with the outbreak and escalation of the Great War in 1912.

Aggravated by the scale of the conflict and the arms-race that occurs, Europe was laid to ruin by natural disasters and monster attacks. This cascades, leading to the collapse of western empires such as the British Empire, resulted in the mass independence of ex-colonies.

In the east, post Meiji era Japan saw the failure of western imperialism. This lead to a decade long erosion of previously appealing ideas of expanding Japan's territory, with domestic political tastes focusing on more conservative industrialisation and insulation against disaster. Military expansion, such as the second Sino-Japanese war, was avoided altogether as all-out war would result in cataclysmic outcomes for involved parties.

By 1940, the Kuomintang won the Chinese civil war, establishing the Chinese Democratic Republic. 

Despite this, as countries rebuilt, it became clear that Erasure was a phenomenon that evolves not only with conflict but also economic growth, advanced technology and expansive industry.

In the decades following the Great War, the Japanese government lost the desire to maintain colonies, amidst the difficulty of maintaining overseas power in the face of the growing E-field. 

Global progress culminated in multiple global disasters in the early 1950s, including the 1953 **Erasure Disaster of Japan**, consisting of multiple natural disasters that destroy major cities including Tokyo.

The shock of the disaster, which dismantled global economies, sent Japan into a long period of stagnation and prompted the development of government and social systems such as the Special Zone system, which coordinated the allocation of Artifacts with dense industrial research zones in major cities.

#### Japan's Colonies

The 1953 Erasure Disaster effectively ended Japan's ability to administer colonies. The territories of Taiwan and Korea were abandoned by Japanese leadership, leading to a sudden and extreme power vacuum in these countries.

Following the 1953 Disaster, lingering E-field disturbance in the East China sea and the Sea of Japan made it impossible for Japanese in Korea and Taiwan to repatriate. This also ended effective communication or movement of supplies across water, isolating Japan.

In Korea, the exiled Korean Provisional Government (KPG) took over from the Japanese administration, who lacked the support necessary to maintain control of the peninsula. This led to the creation of the Republic of Korea.

Japanese influence in Taiwan continued, however without the ability to communicate with Japan itself, officials declared a 'temporary sovereignty' of Taiwan that enabled it to act as its own country, with a democratic institution severed from Japan. This transitioned into a permanent system as the Japanese government in 1990 acknowledged Taiwan as being officially independent.

# Academy System.md

In New Tokyo, Stacker Academies (stacker schools) are institutions that conduct training of new stackers as well as artifact research.

### Ranking System

In New Tokyo, stackers are graded on their overall power using a grading system from C to S.

Grading incorporates multiple criteria including affinity, artifact power, tournament record, and professional record.

#### Affinity Score

The Affinity Score (or nullification coefficient) is a measure of a stacker's inherent artifact affinity. It is measured by aggregation of nullification scores using a set of standard artifacts.

A caveat to this system is that non-Japanese such as [[Evangeline White]] have uncharacteristically low NC scores due to a lack of affinity with the standard artifact set.

#### Tournaments

Stacker tournaments are common in Japan, occurring at the school, ward, prefectural and national level. These events compare stackers directly via one on one combat.

The National Stacking Tournament held every year is open to all S-class stackers.

The NST is a 7 round single elimination single bracket contest. Therefore, the champion is the stacker who wins against 7 S-class opponents in a row while climbing the bracket.

#### Professional Record

For stackers who are graduated or currently working, the professional record takes into account a stacker's history in defeating Erasure monsters.

### Souten Academy

Souten is a stacking school attended by many prominent characters.

Considered one of the four top stacker academies of New Tokyo, Souten is home to many of the most competitive students and has an impressive history, having graduated 40 S-classes since its founding in 1980, and several champions of the National Stacking Tournament, the most recent of whom being [[Ayano]].

Out of the four top academies, Souten is the second youngest. The other academies are:

1. ---- Established 1960.
2. ---- Established 1964.
3. ---- Established 1990.

# Artifact Synthesis.md

**Artifact Synthesis** is the concept of purposefully creating artifacts, rather than simply allowing them to emerge naturally.

Once the link between 'memories' and 'artifacts' was established by Kusnetzov in the 1970s, it became plausible that the world's collection of artifacts was not fixed; it could be expanded through intentional effort.

However, the task of creating Artifacts is difficult:

1. Most S-class artifacts are hundreds of years old. Without improving on this baseline, it would similarly take centuries to create new S-class artifacts through a modern day program.
2. Artifacts that are disproportionately strong despite their age are frequently born out of massive human conflict and hardship; the question of how to induce such circumstances is not only a problem in ethics but also logistics, with proposed approaches being questionably sustainable.
3. Since Artifacts are created by humans, their production rate is fundamentally limited by the number of people on Earth.
4. Even with an abundance of Artifacts, the factors behind an individual Stacker's affinity remain elusive and are seemingly random. Therefore, humanity may not be able to utilise such a large number of synthetic artifacts unless they were of a very high grade.

Before the Regression Hypothesis was clarified, it was thought that long-term synthesis projects could create large numbers of A-class artifacts by the 2100s and then S-class artifacts by the 2300s.

However, models of the E-field increasingly predicted that by the time such programs bore fruit, they would have already been destroyed.

#### Vault Projects

Conceived by Kusnetzov and peers in 1990, the idea of an Artifact Vault essentially accepted the inevitability of the Regression Hypothesis. 

Instead of attempting to produce enough Artifacts to suppress the E-field in 'current humanity's lifetime', the Vault project would aim to carry civilisation's Artifacts, and potentially instructions for synthesis programs, through the dark ages and into the humanity that would emerge from the ashes in potentially hundreds of thousands of years.

Vaults would also attempt to warn future humanity of the E-field, and Erasure so that they would have ample time to prepare for it.

Some vaults were constructed in the early 2000s, and were designed to withstand not only global regression but the passing of millennia.

# Artifacts.md

In God of Stackers, the universe's counter to **Erasure** is **Artifacts**. 

Artifacts are ordinary objects that have historical importance to humans. Things like family heirlooms and museum pieces are a common example.

The older and more important an object is, the stronger it is as an Artifact.

All people have the ability to 'use' Artifacts, and gain magical powers in the process. People who have good affinities for this usually become Stackers, and Artifacts become a part of their occupation.

Very weak artifacts, things like childhood toys or old swords can only express abilities if the Stacker activating them has a very high affinity.

A Stacker's affinity is both general (applying to all Artifacts) as well as specific, tending to Artifacts that align with the person's own history.

#### Memories

Memories quantify what exactly gives artifacts their powers.

When objects exist near or are pivotal in the affairs of humans, they gain memories of stories, people or events that involve them.

Humans also carry memories, generally through family heritage and their own culture.

When a Stacker's memories align with those of their Artifact, they're said to "have an affinity" for it.

#### Relationship to the E-field

Artifacts suppress Erasure, but at the same time, rely on it, or the underlying E-field, in order to exert their effects.

Where there is no E-field, such as prior to the 20th century, Artifacts have limited to no effect.

Similarly, the potential of extremely high class Artifacts can only manifest in very strong E-fields. These so called SS-Class Artifacts have limits beyond what the existing E-field can support. 

This paradoxical relationship between Artifacts and Erasure raises significant questions as to what exactly the E-field is, and how it can manifest phenomena that seem to be complete opposites to each other.

#### Activation

Artifacts don't express an E-field negation or other effects unless paired with a wielder who has an affinity.

#### Examples

1. Taki's great grandfather's sword. This sword dates back to a World War and has some importance to Taki's family. It is considered a weak artifact.
2. Evangeline's great sword. This sword dates back several hundred years, and has been used by kings, famous warriors, and other stackers. It is considered a powerful artifact.
3. The Imperial Palace in Old Tokyo. This is not really an object but an entire building. Historical sites such as castles or places of government typically exert an Artifact-like suppression of Erasure but can't really be used by stackers due to its size.

#### Abilities

All Artifacts suppress Erasure. Being near an active Artifact should nullify E-fields according to the strength of the Artifact; and multiple in a single location will be able to nullify stronger E-fields.

Artifacts do not remove the E-field, but they suppress it and its manifestation, lowering its measurable strength. If an Artifact is disabled, the E-field immediately remanifests. Measuring the implicit E-field (whatever is still there during suppression) is not possible with current technology.

A city like New Tokyo which is full of advanced technology, remains liveable thanks to its large population of Stackers and collection of Artifacts, which it absorbs from surrounding areas in Japan via government directives.

When used by Stackers, Artifacts also provide physical protection, mobility and strength. A typical Stacker is comparable physically to an MBT, so many things that would otherwise kill normal people can only injure them.

Artifacts improve their wielder's martial abilities, allowing them to move quickly, jump great distances, or manipulate heavy objects. Weapon artifacts like swords inflict more damage than they would as non-artifacts. For instance, an S-class great sword ([[Evangeline White]]) can pierce 5 meters of steel.

Truly superhuman feats such as flying, are not possible. (though possible with harnesses in [[New World]])

#### Physical Nullification Field

A nullification field is a region of artifact influence that closely adheres to a stacker's physical body. It reduces or blocks most forms of harm, such as:

* Illness
* Physical attacks
* Toxic substances
* Radiation
* Temperature

It can be seen as a passive effect that keeps the stacker's physical body in a 'normal' state. 

#### Power Levels

Stronger Artifacts give greater effects, ranging from E-field nullification to physical damage resistance that improves the durability of the Stacker's body. 

A Stacker's affinity for their Artifact, Artifact power, and skill together contribute to their Letter Class, ranging from C to S.

For ease of comparison, we'll list how the Stacker classes perform in a conventional world against technology (no Erasure or magitech, and pre-New World).

**C**: Taki at the beginning of the story. Exhibits some affinity but has no skill and wields a relatively poor artifact. Can fight monsters, but would die to a gunshot like a normal person.

**B**: Able to resist small arms fire and reach peak human athletic performance without much effort.

**A**: Certifiably superhuman and comparable to early MBTs. Requires an artillery shell or similar to kill.

**S**: Durability or offensive power of a battleship. Could be killed by a cruise missile or hit from a large calibre naval gun.

#### Population

Approximate numbers of Stackers of each class in New Tokyo, and Japan (in parentheses):

**S**: ~100 (200).
**A**: ~1,000 (5,000).
**B**: ~5,000 (50,000).
**C**: ~50,000 (1,000,000).

(Most C-class are not actively serving).

# Central Complex.md

The Central Complex is an underground structure with multiple purposes. These include power generation for New Tokyo, as well as providing emergency shelter for residents. Its most important purpose is to house the **Central Computer**.

The Complex has a modular design, consisting of many vertical slices, which allows it to be extended deeper underground without compromising seismic isolation.

There are 16 different sections of the complex, each of which correspond to a different prefecture of New Tokyo. Each section is around 30 floors deep and structurally isolated from the other 15.

#### Power

The Central Complex generates a large amount of energy for New Tokyo through the use of **E-Field Engines**. This captures strong differentials in the E-Field, abundant in New Tokyo and converts them into power. These are common in Special Zones.

#### Heat
The entirety of the complex is cooled via a closed network of dielectric fluid circulated via pumps. Being located underground helps to stabilise the complex's temperature. In addition, heat is removed from the complex via:
1. Natural draft towers operated above ground.
2. Dumping of heat into large natural waterways.
3. Evaporative and other conventional cooling technologies.

#### Central Computer

The Central Computer occupies floors B10 to B30. The CC consists not only of computers but also emergency power systems, fire control systems, laboratories and maintenance accessways. 

Each alternating floor of the complex contains a designated cluster of CC, across 20 floors and 16 sections yielding 160 individual clusters.

A CC cluster consists of a large array of computers submerged into a bath of dielectric fluid, which is circulated by a large pump.

The cluster on floor B15 of section 2C contains the Fusing Harness, where the human operator, necessarily a hybrid, may operate the entire computer.

The CC can meet the daily needs of operating New Tokyo using only 1 of its 160 clusters. In general, between 1 and 10 clusters are allowed to be activated for any task. If fully stabilised by a Hybrid, the CC can safely operate 150 of 160 clusters before exceeding thermal limitations. Remaining units provide redundancy.

When Ayano joins the Hybrid project initially, CC is only ~10% complete. It is 50% complete when Taki arrives in the Central Complex, with 80 of the planned 160 clusters operable.

# End of the Main Story.md

### Prior Setup: Ayano's Body

At the end of the Investigation arc, Evangeline and Taki discover Ayano's body in the Central Complex and successfully rescue her. However, despite their best efforts, they discover she is unresponsive and remains in a comatose state despite treatment. This is highly disheartening for Taki, who believes she is dead. They transfer her to the care of the EM club and remain unsure what to do. This is unresolved for most of the story.

### Final Fight 1

Nakamura determines that in order to stabilise Ayano (or to harness Desire for his own means), he needs to resolve her regrets. He believes that Ayano's largest regret is her inability to protect and her desire to return to Nishino village, so his solution is to destroy the village using Erasure, turning Desire into a vengeful spirit who would fuse with his own memories and finally create the God of Stackers.

The main characters are reacting to his actions, and once they realise that his plan is to destroy Nishino village, everyone immediately travels there to stop him.

He beats them there, and heads to the Nishino lab to orchestrate a massive Erasure event that creates a monster out of all of the people that have died in Nishino due to past disasters and due to the lab experiments.

The monster is too powerful for anyone to defeat, but Desire, who is actually living within Taki's sword, becomes empowered by the massive E-field and finally manifests in person to speak to him. She tells him they need to save Nishino village, and that she's going to help him.

With Desire's power at an all-time high, Taki's sword becomes an SS-class artifact, and he himself becomes an S-class stacker while he has it. He uses it to defeat the Erasure monster and dispels the entire E-field over Nishino, saving everyone.

### Aftermath

After saving Nishino village, Taki passes out and is taken to his parents' home. The rest of the characters have no idea what happened and don't realise the sword is important. However, one of the stackers in the main party is actually on the side of Dr. Nakamura, and is convinced to steal the sword while everyone is distracted, taking it to New Tokyo.

Once Taki wakes up, he frantically searches for the sword, believing he has finally found Ayano, but cannot find it. Everyone realises that the sword was stolen and is now on its way to Nakamura.

Hino believes correctly that Nakamura may be planning to use the sword, which is a vessel for Desire, in order to create a 'proto-Type 3' using a temporary fusion of his memories, the Central Computer, and Desire in order to become a vengeful God of Stackers.

### New Tokyo Confrontation

Having seen the true face of Nakamura after his attempt to destroy Nishino village, Taki finds him completely unforgiveable. He, Evangeline, Yuuko and the others return to New Tokyo to finally confront Dr. Nakamura. However, as usual, he is always one step ahead of them.

By the time they arrive, Nakamura is ready to undergo the experimental fusion process. He posses Desire, and Rationality, and uses the fusion device to ascend.

### The Proto-God

Fusing his memories with Desire and Rationality, Nakamura becomes a proto-god. Empowered by Nakamura's deep trauma and the vast computational power of Rationality and the Central Computer, he becomes a god with one purpose. To destroy Erasure.

Using the computational power of the Central Computer, the Proto-Hybrid realises that the ultimate evil in the world are *humans*. Humans' very existence instigates Erasure. Their sin, greed and ambition drives their own extinction. The only way to 'save them' is to burn the majority to preserve the core of civilisation. Then and only then, Nakamura claims, can the Regression Hypothesis be reversed.

The combined memory of Nakamura and Desire's raw will to end Erasure have culminated in a ruthless, vengeful God of Stackers. He will not stop at New Tokyo, or Nishino village, or even Japan. He will destroy the world and purify it of humanity's hubris.

#### Final Fight 2 - Part 1

He easily defeats Evangeline, Yuuko and everyone else. It's hardly a contest. 

Taki feels helpless. Hino tells Taki that the only way they can win is to bring Ayano back so that she can fight Nakamura. Taki says this must be impossible; Nakamura currently has Desire (who he believes is Ayano).

Hino tells Taki that Ayano's body is actually still alive and a part of her is trapped in her own mind. He needs to take her into the fusion machine and undergo the process with her, entering her memories and using his own willpower to wake her from her coma and create a partial god.

Seeing everyone else dead or dying at the hands of the Proto-God, Taki accepts and enters the fusion machine with Ayano's body.

#### The Memory Arc

After undergoing fusion, Taki finds himself back in Souten Academy. In particular, he finds himself back in the National Stacking Tournament. But something is different.

This is *the previous year's* National Stacking Tournament. He's re-experiencing the tournament that Ayano won, and she's in there with him. He tries to talk to Evangeline, but she ignores him as if he isn't there.

He immediately goes to Ayano for help, and it turns out she is the only one who can see him. But she's confused and doesn't understand why he's there. The memory ends before he can explain what's going on.

Taki ends up in the Central Complex, in the months after the tournament. He sees Ayano talking to Dr. Nakamura about the Hybrid project.

Again, as he tries to talk to Ayano, to get her help, he's always interrupted. Every time he finds himself reliving different periods of the past. If he tries to tell her anything about the fight with Nakamura or asks her to wake up, he's immediately displaced.

After this, he realises that he isn't time travelling. He is inside of Ayano's memories, and he's experiencing an infinite cycle in which Ayano relives her past over and over again.

After everything, the player, and Taki, finally gets to experience the full truth of everything that's happened to Ayano since she left the village, and to understand the reasons why she left Nishino and never returned home.

Taki eventually ends up back in Nishino village, as a 12 year old boy, and Ayano is there as a 13 year old girl. He realises this is the day that Ayano leaves the village.

Instead of telling Ayano that he won't go to New Tokyo with her, he stops her. He finally tells her that he understands why she left the village, and why she abandoned them. This finally allows him to get a reaction from her. 

He tells her he forgives her, and that he wants to help her. Instead of letting her go, he wants to be with her. He came all the way to New Tokyo to find her. He became a stacker. He fought countless monsters, battled his way through tournaments, defeated evil scientists, and all he wants to do is finally be with her. Not only that, but he wants to help her finally achieve her dream, no matter what it takes.

Hearing this, the young Ayano is confused at first, and asks what kind of nonsense Taki is spouting. He replies that she doesn't have to worry about it, because he's going to New Tokyo with her.

### Confrontation with Ayano

The memory is interrupted, but this time, they appear in the courtyard of Souten Academy, with nobody else around.

Ayano is there. It's her real, adult self. Taki is himself too. It's clear that these are the versions of them from the real world, not the memory-scape.

In this dream-like location that only vaguely resembles the school they both attended as stacker students, Ayano is hesitant to talk to Taki. However, it is clear that she remembers everything.

She says she's sorry and he says he forgives her. She says she's mad that he didn't come with her and he says he's sorry. She says it's okay. She says she shouldn't have dragged him into this to begin with. She self-deprecates about how her obsession with one childhood promise ruined everything and nearly had Nishino village destroyed.

They talk everything out. Inside this world, they have all the time they want to finally deal with everything, and get over the last five years of separation.

Ayano still feels some regret, but once she realises that Taki genuinely forgives her and finally believes in her dream, she starts to cry and Taki embraces her. 

After she's calmed down, they return to the question of the fight in the real world, and how they should defeat the Proto-God.

Ayano claims that even though Rationality fused with Nakamura, that part of her is still fundamentally Ayano. That means that if Taki and her were to attempt fusion with the Central Computer, they could likely obtain half of the system, bringing part of Rationality to their side. That would allow them to fight Nakamura on even terms. God versus god.

Though hesitant, Taki agrees to go through with it. He says he will help her fuse if that's what she needs him to do.

Before leaving the dream, Ayano comments that she doesn't know what will happen to her mind or her body as a result of the fusion. She will likely not be the same person that Taki knew. She won't even be a person any more. Perhaps she would become a force of nature, like Desire, or an impersonal computer, like Rationality. It's unlikely they would ever be able to speak to each other like this again.

In response, he asks her, if it were up to her, would she choose to remain human or would she choose to leave everything behind and become a god?

Ayano says that she would do it, but not alone. The burden of being a god can't rest on just one person. At the same time, she doesn't want to force Taki to bear the weight of her own dreams.

Taki replies that it's not just her dream. It's both of their dreams. After all, they made a promise, and he fully intends to protect that now, even if he didn't back then.

Ayano says it's ridiculous to hold onto something they said as children. Taki replies that it doesn't matter if he still believes in it. He's going to help her shoulder the burden of godhood, even if it destroys him too. He believes in her, and he wants her to believe in him too. Just one more time.

The dream is beginning to fade, and the two of them can see the visage of Souten Academy slowly fading away. They are going to wake up soon.

After a few moments, Ayano tells him that there's something they might never have another chance to do. After all, the coming battle with Nakamura is going to be one to the death, and they don't know if they'll survive.

Taki asks what she's talking about, and she kisses him. The dream ends.

### Final Fight 2 - part 2

Taki and Ayano both wake up in real life and discover that only a few seconds have passed. Furthermore, Ayano is completely awake and has full access to her artifact, the Kogarasumaru. They realise that the fusion worked. They became a Type 3 Hybrid. Not as a single person, but a combined entity, like the Proto God. Ayano's memories, Taki's will, the few clusters of Rationality that they managed to fuse with.

Taki and Ayano both experience each other's viewpoints, and together they confront Dr. Nakamura, who still wields Desire and his portion of Rationality.

Entering a fierce battle with Nakamura, it comes down to the few characters who are still alive to go into the Central Computer and physically destroy the computers that Nakamura relies on. This is Kenji, Yuuko, Evangeline, Hino, etc.

We follow the routes of all of these characters as they attempt to dismantle Nakamura's access to power and computers, while Taki and Ayano are both fighting Nakamura.

Eventually, the protagonists succeed in defeating Nakamura, landing a killing blow on his human body and severing him from both Desire and Rationality. Both aspects of Ayano immediately re-join her, and Taki finds himself losing control as Desire takes his place.

As he lays there, Nakamura witnesses Ayano becoming a true Type 3 Hybrid, and smiles faintly, before dying.

### Aftermath

The story ends with a cutscene. After defeating Nakamura, Ayano discovers she has complete control over the E-field around New Tokyo. The entire Central Computer is running and under her command. It not only obeys her will; she is it and it is she.

All over the city, the massive Erasure disaster lifts, almost like magic. Stackers that had been fighting monsters or rescuing people find the Erasure simply evaporating.

We see the points of view of several characters across New Tokyo and its surroundings as they watch this happen. It is clear that humanity is ushering in a new age.

In Nishino Village, as the people are still rebuilding, they find the E-field vanishing as well. It's a miracle.

# Erasure.md

The Erasure, or just Erasure, is a natural phenomenon discovered by scientists in the 20th century. It acts as an ever-present antagonist to human civilisation, built into the laws of the universe.

It is the natural counter to technology, though it is countered by [[Artifacts]], and can theoretically be controlled via [[Hybrids]].

### **The E-Field**

Erasure has a different level of strength at every location in space. The relation of space to frequency of information Erasure is known as the E-Field. 

Erasure strength is reported on a logarithmic scale. It is measured in bits/second.

Artifacts exert negative E-Fields which nullify the E-Field around them.

Standing in a location where the E-Field is very strong results in DNA corruption, as well as memory loss. Probability of experiencing a Displacement-type event increases.

### **Types of Erasure Events**

High concentrations of the E-Field will occasionally cause spontaneous anomalies called Erasure Events. These are usually **bad** things.


* **Disaster-type**: These are the primary outcomes of an Erasure event. Intense earthquakes, weather events, collapse of structures and direct destruction of technology.
* **Memory-type**: This affects written records, memories of people, and any kind of stored information. Strong E-fields cause these to become unintelligible or unrecoverable.
* **Displacement-type**: The E-Field can induce coherence across parallel worlds, causing memories, objects or people to displace, being replaced by slightly alternative versions of themselves.
* **Monster-type**: In the aftermath of major E-field events in populated areas, destroyed information can coalesce into abstract or monstrous lifeforms that lash out against humans.

### Erasure Monsters

These are abstract creatures, often embodying ideas, memories or concepts that can be formed from the remains of humans, their culture, or their technology.

They frequently possess their own PNFs, protecting their physical bodies from harm. Therefore, the most effective weapons against these creatures is artifacts. However, they can be destroyed using sufficiently powerful conventional weapons such as cannons and explosives.

Left to their own, all Erasure monsters are temporary existences, and will eventually dissolve into the E-field. This typically takes a long time however, particularly for powerful monsters who can take years to disappear.

Not all Erasure monsters are hostile, but many of them are. Most importantly, all monsters radiate information, which keeps the E-field level around them elevated until they disappear. It is imperative to remove them as soon as possible.

### History

Erasure as a scientific phenomenon was first observed in experimental nuclear reactors and computers in the 1900s. Scientists developing reactors saw failure rates and catastrophic events that greatly exceeded anything predicted by existing theory. Attempts to make reactors more stable had worse returns than expected, with additional safety mechanisms seeming to paradoxically cause higher rates of failure in components they were meant to safeguard.

When a similar effect was noticed in the development of computers, and later in experiments conducted by quantum physicists, scientists developed a theory that all of these effects were related. By placing nuclear or computing technology in the vicinity of experiments, something called "Sudden Coherence" was observed. This was equivalent to the instantaneous and inexplicable erasure of information at the quantum level, and seemed to become more frequent in the presence of human technology.

Sudden Coherence was largely ignored outside of experimental research and theoretical physics, until it rapidly grew in the strength up along with advances in human civilisation in the early 20th century. It was during this time that it gained the moniker of 'Erasure'. Erasure had substantial effects on the growing human civilisation, destroying infrastructure, research, and even  books and written records, causing languages to be lost or texts to become unintelligible.

At the same time, humans gained a better understanding of The Erasure, identifying something called the "E-Field", measurement of which could accurately predict the rate and frequency of information erasure at a given point in space.

The relationship between historical objects and Erasure was also discovered. Objects with a strong E-Field rejection effect were referred to as Artifacts.

Once it was discovered that Artifacts could be used to stabilise nearby information, such as research or advanced technology, scientific progress resumed, but to a limited extent. Massive industry as in the early 20th century was no longer possible, even with Artifacts.


### **Threat to Humanity?**

A famous point of uncertainty regarding the Erasure is whether it poses an existential threat to humanity; or, whether it can be lived alongside if carefully managed.

Prior to the 1960s, it was assumed that Erasure, while dangerous, was a natural force like the weather that could be managed. In the worst case, it was assumed that Erasure might prevent human civilisation from passing a certain threshold; but if that threshold was closely ridden, then civilisation and Erasure would merely coexist.

However, after large numbers of artifacts were destroyed in Erasure events such as the 1953 Disaster of Japan, scientific projections of E-field strength and humanity's ability to manage produced the **Regression Hypothesis**.

The Regression Hypothesis is a global extrapolation of the observation that in all experiments, Erasure has a tendency to **over-erase**. In principle, a system whose total complexity increases over time does not reach a point of equilibrium, but rather enters an oscillating state based on the rate of complexity increase. A rapid increase in information results in a higher peak and a lower valley; the system can rapidly increase to a certain point, but will experience an extreme backslide, before eventually recovering.

According to the hypothesis, Earth reached its peak level of divergent complexity in **1975** and is currently in the slow process of regressing to an extremely low level complexity. 

This is not immediately apparent without measurement, as complexity is generally unevenly distributed and in some areas may be increasing. However on a global scale, maintaining certain peaks of information (such as Japan's Special Zones) becomes impossible without widespread destruction in the rest of the system.

By the time Earth exits its regressive phase, this would result in a massive loss of human life, as well as culture, language and scientific understanding.

Since regression models remain the most accurate in their predictions of E-field levels since their inception in the 1970s, the hypothesis is widely regarded as correct. Questions as to whether the process can be stopped or reversed, perhaps through **E-Dampening** remain undecided (until 2025).

#### E-Dampening

A technique used in small scale experiments, this involves manipulating information-dense mediums, either by inscribing additional information or removing it, in order to disrupt an informational system's natural period. However, it requires accurate knowledge of the dynamics of the E-field encompassing the system, and can have disastrous consequences such as amplification of extremes rather than a dampening effect.

### **In-Universe Speculation**

There are a few theories held by characters in God of Stackers.

1. **Previous Civilisations**: If Erasure is capable of destroying information on a massive scale, it's possible that previous human civilisations, potentially highly advanced ones, have existed in the past but all evidence of them has been destroyed.
2. **Great Filter**: This postulates that Erasure can explain the Fermi Paradox, acting as a great filter. This would suggest, concerningly, that reaching a sufficient level of technology results in the complete destruction of a civilisation.

# Hybrids.md


Under some circumstances, human beings (or sometimes objects) in the presence of extremely intense E-fields can undergo **hybridization**. 

Hybridization is an effect that causes an object's existence to become permanently fused with the E-field.

Usually for humans, hybridization manifests as Erasure Sickness, a high-mortality disease similar to radiation poisoning. There is nothing about good about this; this is termed a **Type 1 Hybrid**.

In rare cases, a human can become hybridized without dying, and will instead experience permanent changes to their personality, affinity for artifacts, or immunity to the harmful effects of the E-field. This is **Type 2 Hybrid**.

#### Degree of Hybridization

In the same way that people get different degrees of Erasure Sickness, a hybrid can vary in how extensively it has fused with the E-field.

At the most extreme end, a person can completely fade into the E-field and lose their physical body. They also lose their individuality and consciousness, and can't be considered a 'person' any more.

It's also possible to experience partial hybridization, which will cause a person to become more sensitive to the E-field and be able to gauge its strength without a measuring device.

#### Importance

Hybrids can range from mildly interesting to extremely powerful.

In the Main Story ([[Timeline]]), hybrids specifically gain plot relevance because they are a necessary component of the **Central Computer**. 

Since a hybrid's consciousness is immune to corruption by the E-field, by fusing theirs with the consciousness of an artificial intelligence, a loophole is created which allows humanity to create and operate powerful computer systems.

This was a concept discovered in the late 20th century and inherited by [[The Professor]], whose goal is to implement it in reality.

The fusion of a hybrid with a computer system is tentatively coined a **Type 3 Hybrid**, the creation of which could finally end the struggle between humanity and Erasure. 

Such a hybrid, whose existence is hypothetical, is termed the 'God of Stackers' by Dr. Nakamura, for their ability to wield Artifacts, Technology and Erasure all at once.

### "Disassociation" phenomenon

When a Type 2 Hybrid attempts fusion and fails, it can sometimes result in a disastrous outcome called 'splitting' or 'disassociation'. The fusion process itself consists of a highly intense bombardment of both the human and computer with Erasure. If successful, this should result in the mixture of information from both entities, causing them to hybridise as the same entity. However, if this fails, the applied Erasure can result in the permanent separation of the candidate into constituent parts. For example, it can split a person's memories from their will, or their consciousness from their body.

### List of Hybrids

1. Ayano. A strong hybrid who gained control over artifacts as well as the E-field.
2. Taki. A partial hybrid who gained artifact affinity. Not very powerful though.

# Main Characters\Ayano.md

Ayano Hasegawa grew up in a rural Japanese village, until it was attacked by monsters when she was ten years old. In the months after the incident, she contracted a disease that could only be cured by doctors from New Tokyo. 

After her parents agreed to the treatment, Ayano was transferred to a laboratory where she met a girl named Ai, who had the same disease as her.

Unlike Ayano who became healthy after receiving medicine, Ai deteriorated. Eventually, she was taken away, leaving Ayano by herself.

As Ayano took more tests, the New Tokyo doctors became confident that she was healthy. Hearing this, she wanted to return home to her village. 

Due to her excellent test results, the lead researcher suggested that she should become a Stacker. Ayano refused because she wanted to go home to see her family, and she was allowed to do so.

After returning, Ayano found herself unable to return to ordinary village life. She kept thinking about Ai, the lab, and about New Tokyo. Seeing the destruction that Erasure had caused her hometown due to the scientists' meddling, and the stark difference between the countryside and the Special Zones, she realised her life in Nishino would never be peaceful as long as Erasure and the fear of it reigned over her.

After a while, Ayano decided to take up the New Tokyo scientists' offer to become a Stacker. She told Taki and the others in the village that she was going to become a powerful Stacker, and eventually return to protect everyone. Ayano had hoped Taki would accept her offer to come with, but he ultimately declined. After leaving, she maintained contact via letters, but after a while, stopped due to her involvement with the Hybrid project. 

Once Ayano reached New Tokyo, she quickly became a top student. Her unusually strong affinity for Artifacts allowed her to win the Stacker Tournament with ease and she graduated as an S tier Stacker.

---

After graduating, Ayano was recruited for a special project that was slated to turn the tide of humanity's rivalry with Erasure and the E-field.

At this time, Ayano became aware of her hybridization that was the cause of her strong Artifact affinity, and agreed to work together with Dr. Nakamura on the project.

Things go well at first, but over time problems with the project begin to surface.

Despite being a hybrid and New Tokyo's strongest Stacker, Ayano is unable to stabilise the supercomputer. She splits into three parts, each corresponding to a different aspect of her as a hybrid, with two remaining inside the Central Computer and unable to leave.

Dr. Nakamura begins to lose his sanity over time due to repeated exposure to intense E-fields. The same is true for the other staff and researchers who work on the project.

While trapped in the CC, Ayano notices Taki's hybrid status and the possibility of him fusing with the Central Computer to free her. She uses New Tokyo's computer systems help guide him to the Central Complex, even helping to cheat his test scores and sending money to his family to prevent him from dropping out or being expelled. 

Ayano as Desire becomes her own character, somewhat distinct from the Ayano in the CC. Desire eventually is able to manifest a physical body using the E-Field. She has memories of her childhood, but is somewhat child-like and lacks the emotional or intellectual maturity of her counterparts. She helps Taki and others to reach the CC, where they can undergo the fusion process.

#### Personality

Ayano is a dreamer. She's ambitious, and naturally competitive, but also deeply empathetic. Her naivety and desire to protect people contrasts with her developing sense of realism in a world where one person's efforts may not be enough.

After seeing what lay beyond her hometown, and the power that Stackers had to protect people, it became her dream to become one. As she became stronger and saw more of the devastation caused by Erasure, this budded into a desire to see a world where Stackers would no longer be necessary.

She has an aversion to burdening others, which leads to her becoming isolated, and overburdened. Her pursuit of increasingly ambitious goals, and her struggle to continue in the face of crushing adversity, weighs on her mental state. 

Her passion and ambition is her greatest strength, allowing her to surpass every other character in the story, but her Achilles' heel is the fragility of her will to keep going towards a dream that feels far away.

In spite of her immense power, it is only with the help and support of other characters that Ayano can finally achieve her dream.

#### Concept

Ayano's story is one of sacrifice, isolation, and eventual redemption. Her character represents someone willing to give up everything that they have, including their own happiness in pursuit of great ambitions.

Her arc explores the things that can be achieved by such a person, but also the toll it takes, and how close it bring someone to the brink.

Paradoxically, the same actions and self-isolating personality that led her to New Tokyo, and to the hybrid project also result in her being unable to fuse with the central computer. 

After being forgiven by Taki, Ayano in her fractured state is finally able to come to terms with her past, unites her identity and goes on to usher in a new age of humanity as the Goddess of Stackers. 

#### Relationships

**Dr. Nakamura**: Ayano is good friends with the Professor, but finds herself drifting away from him as the old man's sanity is tested. She admires him as a visionary, and the reason she became a part of the Hybrid project in the first place; but she also recognises that unlike her, Nakamura is only human.

**Taki**: More than just her childhood crush, Taki is a reminder of Ayano's childhood, and the glimpse of the ideal world that she wishes could exist. Her distance from her family, and from Taki, erodes her confidence in what she's trying to achieve in the first place, causing her to feel lost by the start of the Main Story.

#### Abilities

(God of Stackers)

After the failed fusion, Ayano splits into three entities, each wielding her humanity, rationality and personal will.

Ayano's Desire disappears into the E-field, and retains influence over the story in her own way.

Desire can't communicate with the other parts, but she becomes completely integrated into the E-field, using it to see things that happen in other places, and also to intervene in them.

She uses this to do several things that drive the plot of the story:

1. She intervenes in Evangeline's fight with the Aberration inside the Old Laboratory.
2. She assists Taki during his fight with the monsters in his village.
3. She will sometimes intervene in situations where Taki may potentially die.

Desire is only able to intervene when two conditions are filled:

1. The presence of an object that holds importance to her, such as Taki's sword, or Ai's doll.
2. A strong E-field.

As Humanity, Ayano has no real powers beyond speaking to Rationality, and remains trapped inside the Central Computer.

As Rationality, Ayano has complete control over the Central Computer, but not the E-field. She has limited understanding of what she wants or needs to do, and needs to be directed by Humanity.

#### Artifact

Ayano's personal artifact is the 小烏丸 (Kogarasumaru), which she claimed after the 2021 NST.

#### New World

In New World, Ayano's powers are greatly expanded as a result of her aspects recombining and her becoming a Type 3 Hybrid. 

See [[New World]].

#### Trivia

* Ayano also competed recreationally in a sport known as 撃剣 (*gekiken*), which involves sparring using a bamboo sword. In New Tokyo it can be practiced without protective equipment, as long as the *shinai* are not artifacts.
* Her favourite food is mochi.

# Main Characters\Evangeline.md

Evangeline is a naturally gifted stacker from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and an S-Class stacker. She wields a great sword dating back to the 16th century, which was restored and repurposed as an artifact.

Her father is a high ranking aristocrat in London; a sanctuary city where, like many other European cities, artifacts are amassed and rivalries with other cities is both ongoing and violent.

Europe, fractured into many nations and smaller city-states, is in a stance of constant war, often making use of Stackers, conventional weapons and magitech where available. The continent is an ongoing struggle over artifacts and resources, with Erasure being a part of life.

Evangeline's father has sent her across the world to Japan, an isolated superpower where her goal is to enter the Japanese Academy System, learn from it, and eventually, to return to Europe where she can help him secure power.

In reality, Evangeline wishes she could use her power to end the cycle of violence in her homelands, uniting Great Britain, France and Germany into a kingdom that can take a combined stand against Erasure.

To that end, she is studying at Souten as an exchange student, with the goal of becoming stronger, and winning the NST before she returns to Europe.

#### Personality

Evangeline is a realist, making use of what she has instead of placing her hope in unproven solutions. However, she is ultimately optimistic when it comes to one's ability to influence the future. She believes the path forwards is forged in personal strength and political mastery.

Her slight protagonist syndrome and understanding of European classist hierarchies as 'normal' can cause her to come off as a bit pretentious to other people.

Her family background doesn't help with this impression either, as she was raised with formal training in state affairs by her father, a powerful aristocrat. Furthermore, she comes from a Europe where liberalist ideas largely died out; concluding instead on a rigid society reminiscent of feudalism. She even initially dismisses [[Taki]] as a 'serf', though, she comes to view him in a more positive light later on.

She believes strongly in chivalric ideals, viewing herself as a warrior not just against other stackers but against Erasure itself. In particular, she believes that Erasure is God testing humanity.

Despite her serious exterior, she cares deeply about others, as anyone who knows her well will attest. While her thoughts are usually occupied by the problems facing her home continent, she does make the occasional unexpected joke, usually catching everyone around her off guard.

#### Abilities

In the Academy System, she has the #40 rank among S-class stackers. However, her tournament record suggests she is closer to rank #20. In her debut in 2023, she advanced to the 3rd round of the NST before losing to Ayano Hasegawa. 

Her weapon choice places her in the same category as 薙刀 and 大太刀 users, and with the exception of archers, she has a range advantage against most opponents.

She's also a capable pilot, and quickly adapted to using the Type 10 harness on missions. 

Evangeline also expressed surprise upon discovering a PRS-95 in Japan. She has been shown to be skilled with a firearm.

# Main Characters\Taki.md

#godofstackers 

Taki is a Japanese boy of high school age. He grew up in a rural Japanese village, along with his childhood friend Ayano until the village's destruction seven years ago by an Erasure event. At the time, she contracted a fatal disease and was taken to New Tokyo for treatment. 

Ayano eventually returned and stayed for three years, but the effects of her illness were lasting. She told Taki that she was going to New Tokyo to become a Stacker; the doctors said that was the only option to truly cure her. She suggested Taki come with her, but he declined. He had no affinity for Artifacts, so it wasn't possible.

After Ayano left, Taki stayed behind in their hometown. As he grew older, he helped his parents rebuild their farm and tended to the fields.

When his village is once again attacked, Taki stands up against the monsters and tries to defend his family's farm. All he has though, is an old wooden training sword that Ayano gave him before she left.

The monsters are about to overwhelm Taki when he is saved by Evangeline, who intervenes to defeat the monster.

Evangeline tells Taki that he should come to New Tokyo and become a Stacker, since he has potential.

Taki is hesitant, but he decides to do it because with the earnings he can get as a Stacker, he could pay to help rebuild his family's farm. 

Once arriving at Souten Academy in New Tokyo, Taki settles into his new life as a student, though it's a bit of a struggle, since he has no real talent. He frequently relies on help from Evangeline, Yuuko and Hino to get through school.

It's here that Taki hears about a Stacker named Ayano who won the Stacker Tournament without losing a single battle. He thinks this is a strange coincidence, because his childhood friend was also named Ayano.

However, the more information he looks for on Ayano, the less he finds. None of her old professors will say anything, and her friends don't know what happened to her after graduation.

#### Personality

Taki is motivated and determined by nature, however he suffers increasingly from feelings of inadequacy and being out of his depth.

He willingly accepts heavier responsibilities throughout the story, beginning with his parents' farm, trying to succeed at Souten Academy, to saving Ayano and possibly being a focal point of defeating Erasure itself.

He's not a dreamer, but he keeps moving forwards. In contrast to Evangeline or Ayano, he doesn't have any great visions for the future. However, if life can be a little better, he'll strive for that.

While not ambitious himself, Taki believes in the dreams of other people, such as Ayano, and works to help make them a reality, even if he doesn't really understand them. To him, the happiness of people he cares about - his family, friends or Ayano - matter more than any kind of lofty ideals.  

Despite being the protagonist, Taki is not the strongest person in the story. He doesn't have the ability to rival them, due to being stuck in B class. His ability to influence the story stems from his inability to give up, and the relative simplicity of his goals; in contrast to characters like Evangeline or Ayano. 

In the end, his simple desires and persistence are pivotal to ending humanity's struggle against the Erasure.

#### Relationships

**Kenji**: Taki's best friend at Souten Academy, a classmate with B-class stacking ability. Like Taki, Kenji has serious confidence issues thanks to being surrounded by S-class and A-class stackers. The two bond over a mutual desire to become stronger, helping each other to get through their first year at the academy.

# Main Characters\Yuuko.md


Yuuko is a Japanese high school girl. She was born in New Tokyo to a military family, and is trying to become a Stacker.

Despite being an A-class, she's the fifth strongest student in Souten, only two ranks below her rival and classmate, Evangeline White. She's also had the opportunity to participate in the NST due to her high ranking.

Her weapon is a 16th century _Tanegashima_ (種子島). It was passed onto her by her father, who was an S-class stacker before his death.

#### Personality

Yuuko is a competitive but disciplined girl. Her goal to become an S-rank stacker is hindered by a naturally low artifact affinity, but that doesn't stop her from being one of the school's strongest A-classes and an eventual mentor for Kenji.

#### Relationships

**Evangeline**: Her classmate and rival. Yuuko frequently finds herself at odds with this girl, but they are also good friends.


#### Abilities

# Meta\Multiverse Guidelines.md

Used for crossovers, collaborations and comparisons with other settings.

To prevent this from completely breaking down, there are three crucial assumptions that need to be made about how God of Stacker's mechanics interact with other universes.

1. In all universes, the E-field **exists** and is generated by advanced technology. Artifacts, hybrids and certain types of E-field generators generally work if displaced.
2. In other universes, Erasure **does not exist**, or at least, it is not significantly stronger than ordinary entropy. Technology and divergent information is not degraded.
3. In every universe, human memories **interact with the E-field**. This means that even artifacts from other universes still resist interference by a hybrid field.

This isn't perfect, but for comparisons of common denominators like technology, etc. it is relatively good.

# New World\Characters\Lilya.md

Full Name: Lilya Polonskaya.

Lilya is an S-class stacker from the western Soviet Union, specifically Belarus. She is mentioned in passing by Evangeline and appears in New World.

Regarded as one of the strongest stackers in Europe, she works with the Red Army in counter-monster operations across Belarus, Ukraine and Russia.

#### Appearance

Lilya is a 22-year old woman with white hair and blue-grey eyes. She is frequently shown in her Red Army uniform, which sits over the top of her armour. Her Bulawa is carried at her waist, and a large anti-stacker gun is slung over her back, along with her spear.

#### Abilities

Lilya possesses multiple S-class artifacts.

* Hetman's Bulawa. This is a ceremonial mace used by kings and hetmans (military commanders) since the 13th century in Ukraine.
* Hussar's armour. Lilya's armour, consisting of 17th century cuirass and spaulders, is a partial set of restored armour that was used by one of her direct Polish ancestors.
* Saint Maurice's spear. A replica of the Divine Spear dating back to the 1st century. The restored lance head is mounted on a 175cm birch shaft. 

In terms of firearms, she also uses a Противобожественный ружьё Caкoвіч 20 , or a Sakovich-20. This is a 21st century anti-stacker gun around 170cm in length. It's capable of defeating the PNFs of A-class stackers in artifact armour, and is comparable to the Japanese Type 23.

# New World\China.md

A brief discussion of the Chinese Democratic Republic, their Hybrid program, military program and relationship with Japan.

### Government

[redacted]
### Hybrids

In 2030, following in the footsteps of Dr. Nakamura and the God of Stackers project, the Chinese government produced the National Supercomputing Center (NSC) in Beijing, and successfully fused it with the S-class stacker [redacted].

### Military

The military of the CDR follows slightly different doctrinal thinking to Japanese counterparts. In particular the Chinese Army (CA) employs significant numbers of tactical nuclear warheads, vehicle mounted TNKWs, and standardised harnesses.

#### Neutron Bombs

These are tactical weapons designed for use in contested E-fields. Neutron bombs are nuclear explosives designed to produce high amounts of neutron radiation, targeting electronics and personnel. 

#### Harnesses

The CA emphasises the use of A-class stackers in harness. The standard harness is the Type 33, which remains in service as of 2045.

Type 33 harnesses aim to find the balance between protection, mobility and firepower, enabling A-classes to operate in a vast range of combat theatres.

Basic specifications for the Type 33 as of 2045 are:

* Armour. Depleted uranium, staballoy or tungsten, monolithic ranging from 100mm to 200mm thick.
* Main armament. Standard-issue 76mm ASG firing 60 rounds per minute. 
* Secondary armament. Pair of TNKW missiles with yields of 50tons each and 1000 500g tungsten penetrators. Also compatible with neutron warheads or kiloton fission explosives.
* Detachable mobility module. For ground operations, wheels powered by turbine or diesel engines taking the harness up to 90 km/h over flat and 60 km/h over rough terrain. Without an engine, the wheels can also be manually driven up to 20 km/h by most pilots.
* Ablative construction. The pilot can discard damaged components and the Type 33 can function at a reduced effectiveness without power. Additionally, if a full Type 33 is not available, it can be made to work with only a few components, or with battlefield substitutions.
* Range. Better than Japanese counterparts; 250km without refuelling.

For around 5,000 A-class pilots, the CA possesses an estimated 5,000 Type 33 harnesses as of 2045. These are supported by 100 times as many B class and non-stacker personnel.

The CAF Type 35 is an air superiority harness based on the Type 33, with integrated flight capabilities. A Type 35 reaches 850 km/h using jet propulsion. It retains the armour of the Type 33, and the 90mm ASG is traded for a 76mm ASG at 80 rounds per minute. There are 1,500 Type 35s in 2045.

#### Selective Hybridization

Unlike JDF harnesses, the CA leaves harnesses un-hybridized, meaning they rely on either their pilots' Artifact nullification fields or a nearby H-field to operate. This reduces strain on the NHN (National Hybrid Network). 

#### Long Range NKBMs

With the development of hybrid programs in the US, Europe and the USSR, NKBMs are mounted on longer range platforms (ICBMs) with the ability to deter countries outside of the Asia region.

[redacted]

### Trade

##### Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic

The KSSR is a major trading partner and source of yellowcake for the CDR, exchanging it for hybrid technology, industrial machinery and later refined weapons-grade uranium. This trade route was a contributing factor to the USSR's post-2045 revitalisation.



---
# New World\Economics.md

#### Economics and Social Hierarchy

Having lived in Nishino village, moved to New Tokyo and been able to experience both sides of pre-Hybrid Japan, Ayano feels obligated to play a role in ending the Special Zones system which while justified, relegated much of rural Japan post-1950 to low tech, agrarian life.

With Erasure gone, coastal Japanese cities such as Tokyo, Osaka, Fukuoka, Nagoya etc. expand rapidly once again, rebuilding to pre-1953 levels of industrialisations. Industrial, economic and educational hubs are spread across Japan, enabling a shift away from agriculture and manual labour.

At this stage, economic reforms are largely driven by the Japanese government, with Ayano acting as an enabler. With the creation of the JCN and the use of Hybrid central planning, economic policy increasingly moves into her jurisdiction.

This results in a brief period of manual industry (factories, assembly lines) transitioning into a service economy by 2035 with industry being automated by the JCN. 

During the period between 2025 and 2030, Japan secures generous trade agreements with China to acquire food and mining rights to large quantities of natural resources. These agreements strain as China acquires a Hybrid.

#### Trade Expansion

Predicting an emerging Chinese hybrid, Ayano encourages the fortification of southern Japanese islands and establishes market operations across Southeast Asia, exchanging hybridized technological exports for natural resource access. In 2036, Japan makes official contact with the isolated 5 million inhabitants of Australia and introduces the country to the growing global economic network.

Australia is essential in providing:
* Steel for general industry
* Uranium for nuclear industry
* Aluminium for rocket propellant
* Agricultural capacity.

By expanding the suppression field, Japan also gains access to deposits of rare earth minerals in the Japanese seabed, beginning mining operations in 2039.

In 2041, China enters the existing trade network. The existence of multiple suppliers of hybridised technology leads to trade competition.

#### Synthetic Fuel

In Japan, most energy is provided by nuclear reactors and E-field engines. For military use, it also produces a modest quantity of synthetic aviation fuel and Fischer-Tropsch diesel.

The CDR uses a mixture of energy sources, including E-differential, coal, gas and nuclear power for civilian use and natural diesel for military use.

In the USSR, and North America, natural petroleum and diesel still make up a large share of energy production for all use cases.

#### Nuclear Industry

In the 20th century, nuclear technology was understood to be non-functional at worst and hazardous at best due to radiation from fissile materials and the possibility of runaway reactions.

Analysis by the Central Computer and later the JCN showed that nuclear power, within the umbrella of a Hybrid suppressed E-field, was not only possible but also less dangerous than initially thought.

It was a known property of PNFs, even B-class ones, to provide protection against the various effects of nuclear radiation, such as ionisation, neutron capture, and DNA damage. Clinical tests conducted over several years revealed the extent of this. The PNF of any person with a B-class artifact enabled tolerance of around 1500 mSv indefinitely without negative health outcomes. In the case of acute poisoning exceeding this threshold, PNFs also increased survivability by reducing the effective dose.

Further research in the 2030s confirmed that runaway reactions could frequently be stopped by inducing Erasure in the fissile material. Refinement of this method, involving direct intervention in the fission reaction using the H-field, also led to continuous improvements in reactor efficiency and design miniaturization.

# New World\Hybrid Field Mechanics.md



The artificial E-field that is produced by a Type-3 Hybrid is sometimes referred to as a Hybrid- or E_H-Field to distinguish it from the natural E-field, or the E_N-field as described by the Kusnetzov Equation. 

A Hybrid can be viewed as a network combining a computational entity (C) with a human entity (H), and contributing to an additional dynamic over the latent E-field.

The effectiveness of a Hybrid to operate as a single entity is limited by the loss of information between the two partitions of the hybrid network. 

C, lacking a consciousness and therefore a will to exert on the E-field, is not able to directly influence the H-Field dynamic. However, its information processing capacity is essential to H who serves as the focal point of the H-field.

Communication between the human node and the greater hybrid network seems unlimited in theory, however it is currently subject to the limits of **field diffusion**.

Field diffusion describes the manner in which information contained in the E-field propagates through space. It's been understood, albeit not well, for a while that information which appears 'destroyed' by Erasure can actually still be observed by hybridised instruments. In particular, we can refer to experiments conducted in the early 2000s, where naturally hybridised iron was used to detect E-M waves from destroyed transmitters. 

Using field diffusion, C's primary method of communication is the use of Erasure to destroy its own information, thereby transmitting it to H via the E-field. This is a lossy process that is sensitive to distance, which is clear from the field diffusion equation itself, and so in practice a hybrid's human body should remain in close proximity to the rest of its network.

Specifically, to calculate the amplitude of the E_H-field, we can model the hybrid using a spatial flow network, equipped with the field diffusion equation as our metric. This is the same theoretical model I published in 2015, so you are all probably familiar with it. 

The E_H-field in turn is described by a point-source E-field, where Kusnetzov's divergence parameter is replaced by excess(H) from our flow network. So, a hybrid's influence over the E-field is directly a result of how much information they can create and destroy, and how of it they can avoid losing through field diffusion.

# New World\Hybridization.md

With access to a Type 3 Hybrid, object hybridisation becomes a simple affair.

An information-possessing medium, such as a piece of equipment, complex system, or memory device would normally decay in a neutral E-field due to standard informational destruction induced by Erasure.

In natural settings, objects or people can sometimes hybridize, and become recognised by the E-field not as a deviation from the natural order, but rather completely neutral entities that are aligned with the E-field.

Type 3 Hybrids can induce this effect in information mediums, allowing them to persist without decay even outside the hybrid's range of total suppression.

However, the process can also be reversed by a hybrid if entering its region of influence, causing the system to quickly break down.

Maintaining hybridization is an active task for a hybrid and drains computational resources. This is also means that hybrids can willingly de-hybridise objects and also identify when other hybrids have done the same, regardless of the location of said object.

Hybridization has been shown to become less effective the more distant it is from the hybrid responsible for stabilising it.

#### Unique Abilities

In addition to those mentioned in [[New World]]

1. Extension of an artifact's Physical Nullification Field. Since hybridized computers (and objects in general) are an extension of a hybrid's body, they also inherit the protective PNF that artifacts grant. However, creating a massive or very strong PNF effectively dilutes the artifact's power, so this power is instead concentrated over Ayano's physical body to minimise the chance of a fatal accident.

#### Limitations

Though objects can be preserved 'as-is' using artificial hybridization, the same doesn't extend to any new information they carry. A message written onto a hybridized medium outside of a H-field will still decay according to background Erasure.

# New World\MLD.md


#### 2055 Projections 

(2035 data. Source: Central Computer, JCN)

Presented to the 国会 in February, 2035 by 長谷川あやの.

10 year projections assuming Japan begins production of its own NKBMs.

By 2055 relative stockpiles may reach:
Japan: 20,000 KBMs. 1,000 NKBMs.
China: 7,500 KBMs. 2,000 NKBMs.

After analysing the implications of NKBM proliferation, several strategic concepts have been discovered.

Due to high levels of industrialisation, the amount of compute needed to constrain the E-field grows by around 15% per year. Growth of the JCN outpaces this at 80% growth per year.

Japan manages an approximate 75% rate of Suppression Redundancy. This means it can sustain E-field suppression over itself even with only 25% of its compute intact.

The rate for Operational Redundancy is higher at 95%. This means that hybridised military assets continue to function even if only 5% of compute remains. 

If more than 95% of Japanese compute is destroyed, full deployment of KBMs and NKBMs is no longer possible. 

Beyond 95%, useable stockpile will shrink linearly to 0.

##### Cascading Collapse after 75% destruction

If more than 75% of all Japanese compute nodes are destroyed, that is, the Suppression Redundancy Threshold (SRT) is crossed, then without intervention, it will experience cascading collapse.

Experiments estimate E-field strength in Japanese industrial centers without active suppression to be >1,000 times stronger than peak measurements in the 1953 Erasure Disaster. Peripheral cities such as Sapporo and Fukuoka will be the entry points for Erasure-driven collapse.

Destruction of infrastructure likely to cascade, physically destroying remaining compute nodes via seismic shock, monster events and extreme weather. Computers linked to the Hybrid are not directly affected but their hardware remains vulnerable, due to being protected primarily from directly above.

Network will reach 95% destruction within 1 week and 99% destruction within one month. Japan will be erased from the Earth.

##### No-Retaliation Window

There is a rare situation in which neither total annihilation of both countries, nor total annihilation of a single country can occur after a first strike. This is the **No-Retaliation Window** (NRW). 

If activating a second strike requires 5% of compute and maintaining suppression requires 25% of compute, then an adversary destroying **exactly 80%** of Japan's compute places it in an existential situation.

With 80% of compute destroyed, national collapse can be prevented only if Japan relinquishes second strike capacity. That is, it reallocates 5% of resources from military assets towards suppressing the E-field. This would coincide with surrender to the attacking country, as Japan is incapable of fighting back.

In reality, there is a range somewhere between 75% of 80% which will trigger capitulation without retaliation. This is the NRW.

The size of the NRW depends on the attacking country's own resilience. If only 1/5th of Japan's strategic arsenal is needed to surpass the attacker's SRT, then the attacker would need to destroy between 79% and 80%. If Japan requires its entire strike potential, then the window expands to between 75% and 80%.

Japan's exact SRT, ORT and NRW to be kept secret at all costs, even from the Diet and the Emperor.

### Mutual Likely Destruction

From 2045 to 2055, global relations are likely to enter a MLD phase. This proposes that any first strike between any major Hybrid power is likely to result in erasure of both countries due to retaliation, with a low chance of capitulation of one side due to the NRW.

However, if technology and industry advances sufficiently, levels of the E-field will become so high that the Cascading Collapse will extend across countries and not simply within borders.

This implies that in the event of the collapse of one Hybrid network, the corresponding cascade will continue to destroy every other Hybrid on Earth. Based on experimental data, Japan or China might reach this point between 2050 and 2060.

Once this threshold is reached, it should become in the interest of every country to ensure the complete stability of the E-field, rather than to compete with other Hybrids. This may lead to permanent, global de-escalation as experienced in the 1950s, however, this is an optimistic outcome. 

#### Stability-Instability

As stockpiles of NKBMs grow, all-out war between Japan and China becomes increasingly unlikely due to the threat of MLD. However, this may also encourage major powers to freely engage in smaller scale conflicts over peripheral interests; such as allies in south-east Asia.

Minor inter-Hybrid conflicts will remain be an ever present reality, with complete demilitarization unlikely. The de-proliferation of massive strategic arsenals, such as of NKBMs, could proceed with the cooperation of major hybrid states such as Japan, Korea, China, the USA and European powers.

As the E-field approaches global cascade levels, it may also inspire immediate action from Hybrids whose goals would become infeasible following large scale de-escalation. Therefore, a large and powerful military between 2050 and 2060 is essential to prevent rash action by other states. Furthermore, acceleration of technology, industry and compute will bring us closer to the global collapse threshold, reducing the window available for such conflicts.

#### Rogue Hybrids


While all Hybrids are strictly speaking, highly rational, there is nevertheless the possibility of an emerging Hybrid whose goals are so misaligned with our own that they may disrupt the balance of power and actively prevent de-escalation; or in the worst case, they may actively desire the destruction of humanity.

This seems unlikely, but if such a Hybrid emerged, it would be advisable to form a coalition with existing Hybrids such as China and Korea to eliminate the outside threat.

Japan could take unilateral measures, such as using NKBMs, KBMs or the JDF, but would need to communicate with peer states to prevent triggering escalation.

#### Allied Hybrids

Japan currently maintains strong ties with countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Australia. Some of these countries have high populations and large exposure to E-fields, making it likely that there are fuseable Type 2 Hybrids among them. 

In previous negotiations, some of these countries have expressed a desire for Japanese assistance in developing their Hybrid programs, which as we know require massive resources and expertise. Historically, the Diet has opposed this. However, I believe it is worth considering sharing resources with our closest allies at the very least; the introduction of more friendly Hybrids is a key aspect of softening the possibility of global collapse, as well as a necessity to contain Rogue Hybrids.

As a compromise, we may be able to bring Hybrid candidates to Japan, allowing them to attempt fusion with the JCN. They would undergo training and scrutiny here before returning to their home countries.

# New World\New World.md

The **New World** arc extends the scope of God of Stackers beyond Japan, to an international scale.

After Ayano's successful fusion with the Central Computer with the help of Taki and the other characters, Japan progresses rapidly.

The remainder of the CC is constructed within 2 years and the New Tokyo Special Zone expands in accordance, eventually coming to encompass multiple major cities and merging with other Special Zones.

With 150-160 clusters of the CC operational, Ayano's ability to control the Erasure field from New Tokyo covers all four of Japan's main islands. Special Zones as a concept are phased out and with Erasure gone, the push for industrialization begins, accelerating Japan into the modern era.

For a while, the secret of Type 3 Hybrids remains closely kept by the Japanese government, with Ayano allowed to live relatively normally but in secrecy regarding her role as Japan's Hybrid. This is in contrast to her own wishes to distribute Hybrid technology across the world, which becomes a point of conflict.

The concept of the Hybrid, though pioneered by Dr. Nakamura, is not unknown to other countries, who are quick to develop their own programs independently.

New World focuses on the implications of Ayano's ascendance to a Type 3 Hybrid, and the complexity of transitioning to a post-Erasure world.


#### Type 3 Ayano

Ayano is conferred most of the abilities theorised by Dr. Nakamura, and some that he didn't predict. The main powers she has are:

1. Pinpoint awareness of physical objects inside the E-field.
2. Control over Erasure events and field strength.
3. Merged consciousness with the Central Computer.
4. Linked to the CC via the E-field; physical connection unnecessary.

Her powers generally scale with total compute. More hybridized objects, volume of E-field suppression, or complex use of powers presents an ongoing drain on resources.

She can operate even if separated from the CC, but her power weakens as she becomes distant from New Tokyo.

#### Human Body vs. CC vs. E-Field

Being a Type 3 Hybrid, Ayano is simultaneously human, computer and part of the E-field. However, she also has the ability to divide herself, for example creating multiple instances of herself with varying access to the JCN or control over the E-field.

Feeling that she struggles to relate to other people when communicating with the weight of the entire JCN, Ayano imbues her human body with a version of her that has only limited access to the overall Hybrid.

This results in a relatively normal, human Ayano separated from the vast information currents of the main Hybrid. However, due to her physical body's importance, Ayano is constantly monitored by the primary network via the E-field, who Ayano sometimes calls 'Big Sister'. 

Ayano can still freely access the power of the JCN if she chooses to; such as when she helps Taki with his homework at Souten Academy.

#### Industrialisation

With the use of hybrid supercomputing and the ability to apply decades of research done in New Tokyo, industrialisation and the pivot to advanced technology is rapid, similar in scale to Japan's Meiji period. 1970s - 1990s technology becomes standard throughout the country, with compute-heavy fields such as material design reaching 21st century standards by 2040.

#### Domestic Politics


Ayano, despite wielding the Central Computer, prefers for Japan to retain a democratic government similar to its post 1953 structure. She acts as an advisor to both the National Diet and the newly formed Japanese Defense Force, converting national goals into projections and detailed plans.

In 2029, the Hybrid Amendment is passed, modifying the Japanese Constitution to grant limited executive powers to a Type 3 Hybrid who is nominated by the National Diet. Ayano is nominated and legitimized by the Emperor shortly afterwards.

The 2029 Amendment expands Ayano's responsibilities beyond E-field suppression. However, many of the concessions (military and economic powers) are already carried out by Ayano within a legal grey area, so it is largely symbolic.

Certain parties in Japan, including politicians and civilians, express concerns over Ayano, who exists outside of the democratic system.

Ayano herself shares this concern, initially going as far as to help the JDF plan an anti-Hybrid contingency that would disable her or the Central Computer in the event of her violating her constitutional powers. However, in the event that Ayano were to truly staged a coup against the Japanese government or take control of the military, there is relatively little that anyone can do. 

While the situation remains stable, with the Diet generally siding with Ayano, this could change drastically if another Hybrid enters the picture.


#### Object Hybridization 

A developing technology extending the effectiveness of Type 3s. By manipulating the E-field, Ayano can induce artificial hybridization of objects. However, these are not independent hybrids, but extensions of herself.

An object, referred to as 'hybridized' can act as a synthetic artifact, nullifying the E-field without the need for an artifact. Unlike artifacts, hybridized objects don't grant powers or physical properties. 

Hybridization also dissolves in the field of another Hybrid, limiting use to the original Hybrid's region of influence, or neutral regions.

#### Adaptation of New Tokyo

Without the threat of Erasure events, New Tokyo loses the need for extensive anti-Erasure defenses or earthquake resilient construction. It shifts towards being a center of government.

The city's defense budget is pivoted towards industry, education and the New Tokyo Interception Network (NTIN). 

The NTIN defends the Central Complex from KBMs using missiles and kinetic interceptors. 

As a last line of defense, the top two floors of the CC were replaced with 5-meter thick composite armour modules. These are constructed out of boron carbide and UHPC (ultra-high-performance concrete) with the ability to stop standard 3 ton ballistic rod penetrators.


#### Japanese Computing Network

Recognising the vulnerability of the CC to coordinated attacks (or later, KBMs and NKBMs), a successor to the CC, named the Japanese Computing Network (JCN) begins construction in 2027.

The JCN is a distributed network of smaller supercomputers across ex-Special Zones, with even smaller clusters distributed throughout Japan and networked together. 

As well as helping Ayano to maintain the zone of E-field suppression over Japan, the JCN is necessary for operating most of Japan's industry, military, scientific and social programs.

In real world terms, the JCN in 2025 (just the CC) is roughly equivalent to 5 exaFLOPS. This grows at an average of 50% from 2025 to 2030, increasing to 80% annual growth by 2045. 

The JCN in 2045 commands a total compute of 106 zettaFLOPS; 8 orders of magnitude larger than the Frontier supercomputer. However, the JCN is incapable of efficiently committing itself to a single task, and is distributed over a vast number of smaller, simultaneous tasks across Japan.


#### Hybrid Exclusion Zone

Japan institutes a 100km region around its coast forbidding the movement of other countries' hybrids or construction of extensive computing infrastructure.

#### Stackers

Stackers remain powerful, especially S-class ones, but their role changes. Since they aren't needed for defense against Erasure any more, many Stackers either choose civilian life, or transition into the militaries of emerging powers.

Rather than fighting monsters, Stackers overwhelmingly expect to face off against other Stackers, and hybridized military hardware.

#### Nuclear Technology

With Hybrids able to nullify the E-field, nuclear technology becomes possible but sees slow adoption pre-2035.

In 2030, Japan's first nuclear reactor begins construction, seeing completion in 2035. The plutonium produced in the reactor is used to create low yield nuclear explosives, used in the TNKW program, and later the NKBM program.

Regarding high yield nuclear warheads, there is little incentive to develop larger bombs as nuclear weapons are still vulnerable to Erasure if used outside a country's own area of influence. 

Tactical nuclear warheads in the 10 kiloton range remain viable in contested E-fields, but are not produced by Japan due to limited plutonium stockpiles.

While E-field engines supply most of Japan's electricity, this is increasingly supplemented by civilian nuclear power plants in Japan's interior. 

Many nuclear reactors are non-power generating, production reactors refining Pu-239. Japan operates 6 of these by 2045. 

Notably, the largest nuclear industry belongs to the CDR, who despite only building their first reactor in 2036, construct an additional 15 reactors by 2045.


#### Kinetic Ballistic Missiles

Kinetic Ballistic Missiles (KBMs) are important strategic weapons. The standard is:

3-ton MRBM: Missile with range of 1,000 to 2,000km carrying a payload of 3,000kg of composite rods (steel or tungsten cores).

Propulsion and delivery systems are protected using hybridization, allowing them to function in uncontested E-fields. After reaching an altitude of around 1,000 km, they deploy their kinetic payloads which then fall into contested E-fields with an impact velocity of 7 km / s.

Cluster configurations are also possible, using 10 x 300kg or 300 x 10kg penetrators in one missile. 

Beyond being resisting ambient E-fields due to being unguided projectiles (as opposed to complex warheads), kinetic penetrators also perform the most reliably inside of hostile E-fields, such as those controlled by a Hybrid.


**Japanese vs Chinese KBMs**: 

* Japanese KBM rods are frequently made with steel (later, DU) due to limited access to tungsten. Warheads more frequently clustered rather than single-rod penetrators. 
* Chinese KBMs based on tungsten-carbide with ablative graphite tips, similar to Japanese designs but better at penetrating due to higher rod densities.

#### Nuclear Kinetic Ballistic Missiles

The evolution of the KBM involves the use of a nuclear explosion to impart additional energy into kinetic payloads. The explosion occurs above the influence field of the targeted Hybrid where nuclear weapons may still operate without malfunction.

NKBM payloads are typically 1 ton composite rods (tungsten-carbide & graphite), propelled using a 500t nuclear bomb and a 2 ton ablative plate. This gives the rod a velocity of 15 to 25 km / s (depending on model).

The addition of a nuclear propellant to the standard KBM design results in a weapon harder to intercept or to effectively armour against. An NKBM directly hitting the Central Complex, for example, would easily penetrate 20 meters of carbide-concrete armour.

NKBMs have modest countervalue ability, producing a crater of 200 to 400 meters in diameter.

**Japanese vs Chinese NKBMs**: 

* Japanese NKBMs use smaller nuclear yields with more efficient push-plate designs, reaching up to 25km / s if combining chemical and nuclear impulse. 

* Chinese NKBMs are slower at 15 km / s due to lower plasma velocities, but are more than sufficient in penetration depth.

#### Tactical Nuclear Kinetic Weapons (TNKWs)

 TNKWs are short range, cluster weapons that launch projectiles using nuclear blasts. These are usually direct-fire recoilless weapons mounted on missiles, vehicles or structures.

Unlike NKBMs, TNKWs are designed to release their payloads within 100km of the target, though they can be deployed from any distance using a missile platform.

TNKWs are notably smaller than NKBMs, designed for use against military targets such as ships, armour formations, or stackers.

A typical TNKW warhead will release 1,000 dense 100g projectiles at a range of 50km, travelling with an initial velocity of 20 km / s and spreading them over a radius of 100m to 1km depending on the mobility of the target. The propellant used is a Type 30 Nuclear Charge, which was also reused for Japan's NKBM program.

Land doctrine dictates the use of large numbers of overlapping warheads to saturate targets, while naval doctrine emphasises precision strikes with larger projectiles such as 100kg rods.

#### China

The Chinese Democratic Republic, following the end of the civil war in 1940, entered a long process of rebuilding and enforced strict laws to contain Erasure. This enabled them to survive Erasure under a system with a limited version of Special Zones.

In the 1980s, the country underwent authoritarian reforms, making it quite different in the 21st century when compared with the government's KMT roots.

After developing their own Type 3 Hybrid, they accelerate to the forefront of geopolitics, becoming economic and military rivals with Japan. 

Though harbouring cordial relations pre-2025, the proximity of both powers, distrust and the desire to retain autonomy from each other provoke fears of an arms race.

#### Korea

In God of Stackers, there is no Korean war, leaving a single country which has maintained independence from Japan since the 1940s.

Korea pursues its own Hybrid program, however this is fraught with tension as the country is viewed as a buffer zone between Japan and China.

Despite political setbacks, a Type 3 Hybrid emerges in Korea in 2047.

Korea's emergence as a Hybrid power is the second major turning point in New World, with the potential to either trigger the end of the world or to mediate an era of peace.

Relations between Japan and the hybridized Republic of Korea are tense, with the **Repatriation of Korean Artifacts** being a focal point in negotiations. This is a demand of Korea to return large numbers of artifacts, many of which S-class, that were seized by Japan during the early colonial era. 

#### Southeast Asia

SEA is similar to Europe in that countries such as Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore don't look outwards beyond the immediate region due to limited global communications or trade.

They play a background role, maintaining independence from China and Japan while acting as trade partners.

#### USA and Europe

These countries exist largely outside the scope of New World, however they are explored briefly in Evangeline's Character Story.

The USA and some European countries are known to be successful in applying Hybrid technology, developing multiple Type 3 Hybrids in the late 2040s. 

#### Prospective War

The possibility of all-out war between China and Japan emerges slowly from 2030 onwards, with both countries undergoing economic booms.

This conflict forms a tense backdrop for the main characters of the New World arc.

China possesses a large number of Artifacts and Stackers, with around 5 times as many A-class Stackers and twice as many S-classes. However, with a 5 year handicap they lack the information technology and overall magitech maturity to match Japan; this limits the power of their Hybrid compared to Ayano.

Between 2030 and 2035, China focuses on scaling suppression range over its massive land area in order to liberate its people from Erasure. In 2040, it begins investing in NKBM technology as a deterrent against potential Japanese aggression.

#### Timeline

The main story of God of Stackers (Taki arc) ends in 2025, with the successful fusion of Ayano and Taki with the Central Computer. Stabilised by a secondary Hybrid, Ayano gains full control of the Central Computer as well as merging Humanity, Rationality and Desire.

Between 2025 and 2030, Ayano focuses on revitalising Japan and industrialising the country, expanding Japan's "Human-Field" and eliminating Erasure events. 

In 2030, China succeeds in fusing a weaker Type 3 Hybrid. Ayano predicts this, though it's happened sooner than she estimated.

Anticipating future tension, Japan begins to produce KBMs and advances its rocket technology.

China needs time to industrialise. It starts with a weaker technological base due to the 5 year gap, but a larger capacity for growth.

Japan enforces the Hybrid Exclusion Zone in response to the new Hybrid, aiming to prevent a contested E-field over the main islands. This creates tensions with Korea, who borders the HEZ.

In 2045, a nuclear explosion is detected in LEO over China. Analysis by the JCN confirms a NKBM test launching a 1,000kg tungsten-carbide projectile.

Though possessing a large arsenal of KBMs, Japan had assumed invulnerability thus far thanks to the NTIN and hardened JCN nodes. 

The existence of NKBMs prompt reconsideration of Japan's national and strategic policy.

# New World\Stacker Equipment.md


Equipment used by stackers varies based on the stacker's class, and the area of deployment.

Most info here relevant to post-2025 Japan.

#### Interactions with E-Fields

A quick rule of thumb can determine if equipment will function, based on the E-field and the user.

In a friendly E-field, any equipment can be used by any individual.

In a neutral E-field, any equipment can be used by any individual as long as it is hybridised.

In contested E-fields, equipment can be used by stackers if it is hybridised.

In enemy E-fields, high class stackers or artifacts can be used to stabilise equipment, but will experience decreased reliability.

Practically, the transitions between these four E-field classifications lack hard borders, but specific guidelines depend on mission parameters.

#### Harnesses

These are weapon, protection and mobility systems that are mounted directly to the Stacker, sometimes supported by exoskeletons up to 3 meters tall. They help to distribute heavy loads on the Stacker's person, while also providing mounting points for different types of equipment, supplies or automated systems.

Harnesses are used by Stackers of at least A-class. Therefore, in Japan there only around 5,000 harnesses ever in service at any time.

In real world terms, A-class harnesses cost around 10 million USD, and S-class harnesses like the Type 37 or Type 40C cost up to 100-200 million USD over their lifetime. 

#### S-Class Equipment

For S-Class stackers with naturally high durability, the priority is enhancing long range attack capabilities. Some options are:

* Portable TNKWs. These are recoilless guns around 2-3 meters in length that can be used to fire TNKWs of up to 10kg in payload. Due to the weight of the equipment and the dangers of detonating nuclear shaped charges in handheld weapons, these are only useable by S-class stackers. 
* Missile TNKWs and nuclear warheads. These are suitable in contested E-fields but not in hostile zones, as weapon systems fail after leaving the S-Class's nullification field.
* Smoothbore Anti Stacker Guns (ASG)s. For example, the Japanese Type 23 37mm portable ASG or the larger Type 29 45mm ASG. 
* Conventional weapons. Most harnesses are compatible with conventional missiles, bombs, or munitions for defensive use in friendly E-fields. 

It is also common to use mobility enhancing equipment such as jet or solid fuel propulsion. Unlike portable weapons, these are usually integrated into "full-harness" systems that secure the propulsion systems to the Stacker's body. Type 37s in particular remained popular for enabling mid-flight avoidance of individual TNKWs.

* Type 27 Aerial Harness. Introduced in 2027, this is a modular system that allows the user to mount jet engines, boosters and wing systems that control the flight trajectory. S-Classes using these make use of heavier configurations, with larger boosters and higher accelerations.
* Type 37 Multi-Purpose Harness. This is a more advanced airframe-style harness that incorporates a full aerodynamic surface with integrated propulsion systems and automated flight controls. It is designed specifically for S-Class pilots, being specified for manoeuvres up to 25G and top speeds exceeding Mach 1.

Less common, but still used are defensive options.

* Nuclear reactive armour. These employ shaped nuclear charges to attack incoming projectiles, increasing survivability against ASGs and TNKWs. 
* Active protection systems. These are hard kill systems effective against low velocity anti-armour or anti-stacker weapons.
* Type 40C Full Armour Harness. This is a heavy experimental harness prioritises protection, utilising dense armour composites, ERA, NRA and APS. It offers protection against ASGs, conventional missiles, and Artifacts.

Mobility and defense were eventually consolidated into the Type 45, which remained dominant in the JDF throughout the 2050s.

* Designed to replace the aging Type 37s, the Type 45 offered significantly improved propulsion systems, armour protection, and integration with modern systems.
* Like its predecessors, it retained a modular design philosophy, even allowing S-classes to equip different engine types.
* With the growing prevalence of tactical nuclear weapons, the Type 45 is also designed to withstand proximity nuclear blasts.
* The Type 45 was able to mount ramjet propulsion reaching Mach 3 in interception scenarios.
* Dense armour composites made the Type 45 immune to fire from 37mm ASGs.
* Third-generation NRA protects against TNKWs up to 5kg HVTP, requiring multiple direct hits to exceed a single plate. 

#### A-Class Equipment

Weapons:
* ASGs and Anti-Materiel Rifles. 
* TNKWs (after 2040).
* Artifacts.

Defense:
* ERA
* APS

In Japan, the standard harnesses are:

* Type 10. This was developed as a proof of concept in New Tokyo. It featured a steel frame with jet propulsion and armour, used to assist Stackers in fighting against Erasure monsters.
* Type 28. An improved Type 5 with an extended range and electronic systems allowing communication with the JCN.
* Type 30 / Type 32 / Type 34 / Type 36. The first harnesses designed for military use; these evolved with the introduction of ASGs and improvements in propulsion technology. Type 32s notably prioritise armour protection over other systems, capable of protecting against standard ASGs at the time. Type 34 and 36s served as transitionary models not produced except in small batches.
* Type 38. This harness had a top speed of 1100 km/h, helping them to keep up with Type 37s and supersonic jets. However, it lacked lateral mobility and protection compared to its predecessors.
* Type 40A. The Type 40 was a high mobility harness able to avoid incoming hypervelocity projectiles from ranges beyond 5km, incorporating APS and ERA for lightweight protection against ASGs. 
* Type 40B. This harness, which is completely different to the 40A, incorporates mounting points for large TNKW missile systems, similar to those on truck or vehicle platforms, allowing A-Class stackers to threaten S-Classes from range.


#### TNKW configurations

For use against Stackers in the air, 1000 x 100g TNKWs are used at a range of 10km to 20km, with the aim of damaging propulsion systems in the harnesses themselves, which are usually much more fragile than the wearer.

With a top acceleration of 25g, a Type 37 can displace 30 meters laterally within half a second, creating a cross sectional area of 1,400 square meters. Therefore, the 1000 x 100g TNKW, which can be mounted on a 40B, 37, supersonic jet, or ground platform, presents a viable choice for intercepting an S-Class flying in harness over a contested region.

However, 37s and 40Cs used by S-Classes are often capable of dodging individual TNKW projectiles as well, making successful interception more difficult in practice than the above calculations would suggest.

Very near detonations (within 1km) of the S-Class can guarantee direct hits, but this requires entering the range of APS.

TNKWs can be divided into two broad types; the standard-type and rifle-type munitions. 

Standard TNKWs are mounted on missiles and have better coupling efficiency, achieving velocities of around 20 km /s. Rifle TNKWs are smaller and less efficient with a velocity of around 10 km /s. 

TNKWs can be usually be 'dialled-in' so their spread matches the target distance.

As well as standard 100 x 100g munitions, the JDF also provides single 10 x 1kg and 1 x 10kg rounds.

#### ASGs

Anti-stacker guns are harness- or hand-held rifles and smoothbores used by A-class and S-class stackers. They are similar to anti tank guns or anti materiel rifles of the 20th century.

In the 21st century, these weapons are dart-like projectiles with length-to-diameter ratios of around 15:1 and width-to-calibre ratios between 1:2 and 2:3. Experimentally, this shows the highest performance against powerful PNFs, while also offering decent armour penetration.

Against Artifact users, fast moving, high energy projectiles have proven to be the most effective at breaching the Stacker's physical nullification field, which otherwise protects them from most types of attacks.

The Type 23 was developed in Japan based on the West Soviet PRS-95. It was designed to defeat the PNFs of A- and (some) S-class stackers.

After improvements in armour and harness systems for stackers, in particular the development of the JDF's Type 32 and the CA's Type 33 harnesses, the Type 23 was considered less effective, and superseded by the Type 29 and Type 35 series guns. 

In practice, the Type 23, PRS-95 and similar guns still mission kill stackers in harness, by targeting propulsion, weak points and external systems of the harness. However, their lower velocities result in a range disadvantage.

The Type 23 and Type 29 are common in the JDF, featuring hypervelocity projectiles and high rates of fire. 

ASGs from 2029 onwards are chemical-electric hybrid guns utilising a conventional first stage with an electromagnetic boost stage. The Type 35 series are distinctive for their longer barrels (around 3 meters, or 5-6 in the case of the 35B) and larger sub-calibre projectiles.

| ASG      | Calibre (mm) | Muzzle velocity (m/s) | Rate of Fire (r/m) | RHA 1km | Design  |
| -------- | ------------ | --------------------- | ------------------ | ------- | ------- |
| PRS-95   | 37           | 1,500                 | 70                 | 200mm   | Chem    |
| Type 23  | 37           | 1,700                 | 110                | 250mm   | ETC     |
| Type 29  | 45           | 2,500                 | 60                 | 350mm   | Ch-Rail |
| Type 35A | 45           | 3,500                 | 95                 | 700mm   | Rail    |
| Type 35B | 76           | 5,500                 | 10                 | 1200mm  | LG-Rail |
| Type 35C | 37           | 3,000                 | 180                | 500mm   | Rail    |

Developed by the JCN in 2035, the Type 35 series aimed to modernise the outdated 23s and 29s used by the JDF. These variants offer higher muzzle velocities, rates of fire, and a larger calibre. 

#### Nuclear Weapons

Japan doesn't manufacture tactical nuclear warheads, instead maintaining a large supply of Type 30 and Type 38 Nuclear Charges.

| NC      | Yield | Use-case           | Design                        | U/Pu Required |
| ------- | ----- | ------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------- |
| Type 30 | 500t  | NKBMs, early TNKWs | Implosion-Type                | 10kg U        |
| Type 38 | 100t  | standard TNKWs     | Linear Implosion, D-T Boosted | 2kg Pu        |
| Type 40 | 1t    | NRA, late TNKWs    | Implosion-Type, D-T Boosted   | 1kg Pu        |

Chinese arsenals are suspected to include a variety of both nuclear charges and tactical warheads, but specifications are unknown.
##### Note on NRA armour ratings

NRA armour equivalency is measured based on the NRA's ability to vaporise the entirety of a projectile. This makes it effective against narrow penetrators but less effective against short penetrators compared with static armour such as UDC.

##### Nuclear Pumped Lasers (NPL)

The NPL is a weapon that emerged in 2045. Rather than using a hypervelocity kinetic penetrator, an NPL is a high powered laser. The original NPL was the **Type 42X**, converting 10% of a Type 38 nuclear charge's energy into a 5-nanosecond pulse with wavelengths in the vicinity of 1μm, carrying an initial power of 8 exawatts.

Despite having a large form factor, the NPL is an effective weapon against airborne targets, though it requires line of sight and extremely precise fire control to hit its target at long ranges.

At 10km, the Type 42X NPL retained a power of 4 petawatts, which is considered sufficient to spall the UDC armour of a Type 45 harness, however obtaining mission kill from this alone is unlikely.

Within 5km, a hit by a 42X is equivalent to at least 1kg HVTP, capable of mission killing highly armoured targets. 

In 2050, the NPL concept was revisited to produce the Type 50 NPL. Rather than utilising a nuclear explosion, the Type 50 used a continuous nuclear reaction and improved spall-range of the NPL to 10 seconds at 50km , with the ability to damage optics at 75km. 

The Type 50 NPL was mounted notably on the MJCN-1 and on JDN's aircraft carriers in 2055 as secondary systems.

#### Nuclear Reactive Shield

An alternative to harness-mounted NRA is the Nuclear Reactive Shield, or just Type 40 Shield. This module can be attached to the vambrace of a JDF harness using the standard mounting point. 

The JSF issues a disposable 110x20cm boron-carbide shield with Type 40 nuclear charges embedded into the shield.

Such a shields are rated for multiple impacts of 1kg HVTP, but could only protect a pilot from one direction.

#### Rifle-type TNKW

The first rifle-type was built in 2038 using the new 100 ton nuclear charge. Because of the high yield of the propellant charge, this was only used by S-classes.

The second generation of rifle-types built in the 2040s used the Type 40 1-ton charge and could be used by A-class stackers if used with a harness that shielded the pilot from the radiation blast.

#### B-Class Equipment

In the JDF, personnel who are B-Class Stackers are abundant in specialized roles. They are pilots, vehicle operators, and combat personnel. 

B-Classes in the JDF, numbering around 20,000, are spread across multiple branches of the JDF, in particular the navy and army. 

Japanese Defense Navy - the second largest branch of the JDF, tasked with enforcing incursions on Japan's exclusion zone, protecting trade routes with SEA and Australia, and deploying airwings or TNKWs in contested zones. The JDN primarily fields:

1. Carrier groups. The JDN has four diesel-electric carriers built in 2033, 2036, 2040 and 2045. These support the simultaneous launch of both jet aircraft and S- and A-Class stackers wearing aerial harnesses. They are screened by ASGs, short range missile systems, KBMs and TNKWs.
2. Submarine groups. These are reconnaissance and ASW vehicles positioned across the first island chain. Some carry KBMs.
3. Escort vessels including smaller carriers. These ships equip hybridized missiles, deck-mounted ASGs and A-Class stackers to protect trade convoys.

Japanese Ground Forces - the army branch makes up most of the JDF's logistical chain, operating trucks, trains, combat vehicles, mobile NKBMs and defensive missile platforms across Japan.

Japanese Air Force - largely in support of the JSF (Japanese Stacker Force), the JAF operates a range of aircraft for logistics or tactical support.
#### SPASGs

The self propelled ASG or SPASG, is an armoured vehicle with a top-mounted ASG battery with 360 degrees of traversal and elevation from -10 to 90 degrees. 

For instance, the anti-Stacker Type 33 SPASG mounts a battery of four Type 29 ASGs firing a total of 380 rounds per minute, with an ammo capacity supporting 10 seconds of fire before needing to be manually reloaded. 

Due to the high approach rates and low window of opportunity present when facing an S-class in harness, these 10 of fire seconds are usually more time than the SPASG crew will have available to them.

SPASGs are primarily armoured from vertical and steep attack angles, sometimes using NRA, improving survivability against aerial counter fire. However they are vulnerable to ground attacks by other vehicles, or at close ranges.

Like most equipment, hybridised SPASGs in neutral E-fields can be crewed by anyone, but non-Stackers risk deadly exposure to the strong E-fields present on an active battlefield.

#### CFVs

A Counter-Fire Vehicle or CFV is an armoured vehicle similar to a SPASG except that it is designed specifically to restrict the deployment of enemy SPASGs. A CFV has a high velocity, slow firing ASG such as the Type 35B that allows it to outrange ordinary SPASGs. In addition, the CFV is used to eliminate enemy CFVs, protecting friendly SPASGs.

CFVs are armoured to resisting artillery, fragmentation and glancing hits by lower calibre ASGs. Rather than resisting attacks through armour, they rely on engaging from maximum range using precision targeting, with both direct fire and indirect fire modes.

CFVs are present in most New World militaries, but are used differently. Together with ASGs, they are the central combatant in the JDA, relying on A-classes to support them. 

The CA by contrast treats CFVs as supporting fire vehicles for their more heavily armed and armoured Type 33s. 

#### AAVs

The AAV (Armoured Attack Vehicle) is a cousin of the SPASG, which was produced by the JDF with to match the survivability and lethality of the CA's Type 33 harness without requiring an A-Class pilot.

AAVs are operated by B-Class stackers. The Type 35 AAV is a tracked vehicle with 550mm composite armour, with a Type 35A mounted at the roof of the vehicle. It can be operated by one or two crew, with the ASG able to acquire targets and fire on its own accord.

While significantly more expensive to manufacture, a Type 35 with two crew can be roughly considered equivalent to a Type 33 harness.

Due to their heavy armour, AAVs have no capacity for flight, and have limited top speeds of around 60 km / h.


#### Hybrid Harnesses

Harnesses tailored for Type 3 Hybrid combatants were explored by both Japanese and Chinese research programs at the height of MLD in the 2050s.

##### Shima Mobile Harness

The MJCN-1, or *Shima*, was a collaboration between the Mitsubishi research group, the JCN, and the JDN to develop an experimental harness integrating a high performance computing system with an S-class harness. The MJCN-1 was original designed to be piloted by Hasegawa Ayano's human body, but could be operated by any Japanese Type 3 Hybrid.

At its conception, the Shima was a harness weighing over 100 tons, placing it in a weight class well exceeding even the Type 45's heaviest variants. It was also nearly 10 meters tall and could move its own joints using onboard power.

In tests conducted in 2053, it featured:
* Full NRA coverage, using multi-charge plates rated for 10kg HVTP.
* Integrated APS adapted from contemporary JDN aircraft carriers.
* Ultra-Dense Composite (UDC) armour, graded for 1kg HVTP.
* 1.0 exaFLOPs of onboard compute using a miniaturised JCN node, supporting a 10km E-field.
* A 5 MW nuclear reactor.

MCJN-1 resembled a humanoid warship more than it did a harness; its purpose being not to enhance the pilot's natural abilities, but rather to mobilise and defend a tactical, independent E-field.

Since the MJCN-1 was developed in part by the JDN, it was named according to naval standards. It is referred to in some documents as the 'Shima' harness, after the ancient Japanese province.

In particular, one of the intended uses for Shima was defense against NKBMs, by intercepting and disabling them above 1000km using its own E-field. 

The MJCN-1, while several prototypes were built, was never deployed for any operation.

#### Glossary

HVTP - High Velocity Tungsten Penetrator. Quantifies protection against long tungsten rods (1:30) of given mass travelling at 10 km / s, consistent with 2040s TNKWs.

PRS-95 - The Sakovich-95, a stacker gun developed in the 1990s in the USSR and exported east to China and Japan.

# New World\The Incident.md

This is a major arc of God of Stackers: New World that examines and challenges the moral precedent of nuclear weapons through the lens of non-nuclear interventions.

The Incident takes place in China, where a secondary Type 3 Hybrid has emerged. Not only that, but they have joined and been empowered by an anti-CDR, anti-Japan movement. This fusion takes place completely independently of the CDR's hybrid program.

Beginning with the subjugation of the E-Field over the city of **Xinhuo (薪火)**, the revolutionaries seize large regions of southern China within the first month of the civil war. Senior officers and generals in the region also defect from the CDR at the onset of the war, repelling the loyalist forces in favour of the southern regime.

Due to the opacity of Chinese-Japanese intelligence, it takes nearly a month for news of this to reach Japan, though the JCN had began to suspect something as soon as one week after the war started.

### The Hybrid Civil War

The civil war proceeds extremely poorly for the CDR. Having operate in secrecy since even before the fusion of the first Chinese hybrid, the revolutionary movement continued to survive in the vast regions of the country not covered by the small, national H-field.

Rural cities of the CDR, previously left to the brutal natural E-field, are grateful to be lifted out of Erasure by the revolutionary hybrid and support the new hybrid, providing supplies and manpower to the revolutionary effort.

In particular, the CDR appears to be ill-prepared for such a war, having designed its military for a conflict with Japan or lesser powers. Type 35s far from Beijing's H-field are revealed to be fighting at a severe disadvantage against the CRA's harnesses, and the CDR loses hundreds of A-class stackers within the opening months of the war.

### The KBM / NKBM Question

Unlike the CDR, the revolutionaries openly reject the concept of coexistence with Japan. It is clear that they intend to seize the NKBMs and KBM stockpile of the CDR and use them to depose Ayano, and by extension Japan.

This becomes problematic as in 2047, none of Japan, the CDR, nor the CRA possess MLD against each other. Therefore, all-out exchange of KBMs and NKBMs would lead to a long, gruelling and ultimately apocalyptic war. It is one the CRA believes it would win against Japan.

In September of 2047, representatives of the CDR and Japan meet to discuss a temporary coalition with the purpose of defeating the CRA through a single, joint strategic attack of the NCN nodes controlled by the CRA's hybrid.

Strategically, the idea is sound. Such a strike would save the lives of countless CDR and Japanese stacker forces that would otherwise need to be dedicated to finding a protracted war across the Chinese mainland. Furthermore, it would be pertinent to commit to the strike sooner rather than later, to prevent the CRA from obtaining strategic weapons.

However, the strike would result in regional cascade of the E-field across southern China, killing hundreds of thousands of people.

### Superseding the Hybrids

Ayano votes out of favour of the strike. According to the JCN, the CDR and Japan would win a conventional stacker-based war against the CRA regardless, utilising an extensive stockpile consisting of Japanese naval power, ASGs, harnesses and TNKWs. The tactical intervention would cost the lives of stackers but result in the preservation of the southern Chinese population. 

The CDR Hybrid does not cast a vote. In private, she is approached by Taki who pleads with her to stop the senate from voting for the attack, but she refuses to intervene in the negotiations.

CDR senators, believing that Japan will use the CDR as a sacrificial shield to absorb the majority of losses in such a war, votes to commit to the strike. The Japanese government follows suit in its vote to use a combined KBM strike to decapitate the CRA, overriding Hasegawa Ayano's 'recommendation'.

# Other Special Zones.md

Apart from New Tokyo, there are some smaller special zones located in:

1. Kyushu (East of Fukuoka)
2. Hokkaido (Sapporo)
3. Kansai Region (Kyoto)

These have more restrictions on technology than New Tokyo due to their larger exposure to destruction by tsunamis, etc. but are important hubs for Stackers and contain large numbers of Artifacts.

# Post New World\Characters\Tou.md

Full Name: 北山東 (Kitayama Tou)

Tou was a Martian-Japanese male born in 2110. He became an A-class stacker, and eventually was recruited into the EAA's hybrid program as a candidate. However, he failed to fuse, causing him to eventually drop out of the program. Afterwards, he worked as a restaurant hand, with the dream of eventually opening his own shop. 

During the Martian Erasure Crisis, he was presented with the experimental Yamato-type harness and decided to fuse with it, becoming a Type 3 Hybrid. Due to this, he became instrumental in defeating several SS-class monsters and preventing the destruction of Mars.

After the Crisis of Mars, he is celebrated by the EAA as a hero. Initially, he is thrilled to finally be recognised, and accepts the recognition. However, he comes to resent the Earth powers and the way he is treated as a weapon to be aimed at other Martians. 

### Artifacts

As the pilot of Yamato, Tou came into possession of several S-class artifacts.

* 2 Meibutsu katanas from 14th and 15th century Japan.
* 1 Dao sword from the Three Kingdoms period.
* 11th century Yumi (asymmetrical bow and arrow).
* 17th century Jian sword.
* 18th century **Gichang** (Korean flag-bearing spear).
* 14th century Thai Daab.
* 15th century Rattan shield.
* 13th century Odachi (Japanese field sword).
* 2nd century Donabe (Japanese cooking pot).
* 14th century Wok.
* 17th century _**Nakiri bōchō**_ (vegetable cutting knife).
* 21st century Core of Apollyon.

#### Apollyon's Curse

After defeating the SS-class monster Apollyon, Tou was allowed to keep the monster's core. 

Consisting of only Apollyon's memories, it should be impossible for the core to be conscious or to engage in conversation. However, Tou increasingly feels that the core is talking to him, and even dreams of it when he goes to sleep.

# Post New World\Harnesses.md

Harnesses in the 22nd century are used for .

### S-class harnesses by country

Reference tables of early 22nd century S-class harnesses by combat role. 

| Country | Designation | Mass (kg)  | Top speed | Range   | Year | Produced (amount) |
| ------- | ----------- | ---------- | --------- | ------- | ---- | ----------------- |
| USA     | H-21        | 10 tonnes  | 1.3 km/s  | 4,500km | 2135 | ~120              |
| Japan   | Type 15     | 7.5 tonnes | 1.5 km/s  | 3,200km | 2115 | ~60               |
| USSR    | Gr-22       | 9 tonnes   | 1.8 km/s  | 2,500km | 2122 | ~45               |
| China   | Type 25     | 8 tonnes   | 1.6 km/s  | 3,000km | 2125 | ~80               |

A key component to achieving the mass-thrust and range performance of modern harnesses is the use of **E-field cycling** in application to high performance jet engines.

As a harness flies through the E-field at a high enough velocity, it can capture the energy differentials in the field using a miniaturized E-field engine. 

This energy is cycled back into the primary turbofan or ramjet engine, typically at the afterburning stage. In theory, this can improve the exhaust temperature by up to 500K and fuel efficiency by 30% over ordinary engines, and some models are able to come close to these limits.

#### CAF Type 25

The Type 25 is the EAA's most distinctive harness and was jointly developed by Japan, China and Korea.

Over the previous 21st century and earlier Japanese Type 15, this harness saw significant improvements. Type 25s are divided into two main variants, the Type 25A and 25O, which are the in-atmosphere and exospheric variants.

##### Type 25A

* **Height**: 3.5m
* **Breadth**: 1.75m
* **Wingspan**: 8.5m
* **Empty Weight**: 7,500kg
* **Gross Weight**: 12,000kg
* **Propulsion**: Twin ramjet, geared turbofan
* **Armour**: M-5 Harness Protection System

As for equipment, Type 25s are compatible with:

* 15kg HVTP nuclear reactive shield JDF Type 10.
* Auto-loading nuclear rifle CA Type 98.
* 76mm and 90mm ASGs.
* 2,500kg of chemical or nuclear payload.


#### M05 HPS

The M05 HPS is a armour and protection system developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. It was first conceived in 2105 and saw completion in 2120. It provides advanced protection against a broad spectrum of threats, including:

* 5kg HVTP NRA
* 1250mm RHA and 1kg HVTP equivalent composite armour
* 1.5km APS using K102 ultra-violet phased arrays
* 1 MeV flash and N-Spall protection
* 500kW direct energy dissipation LFM coating
* 4MJ pulse survivability, advanced composite UHTC armour

### A-class harnesses

Multi-environment harnesses used on spacecraft or in EVA.

Table does not include models capable of atmospheric flight.

| Country | Designation | Mass (kg)  | delta V | Range    | Year | Produced (amount) |
| ------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------- | -------- | ---- | ----------------- |
| USA     | LH-15       | 5 tonnes   | 2 km/s  | 28 hours | 2115 | ~800              |
| Japan   | Type 10     | 3.5 tonnes | 2 km/s  | 22 hours | 2110 | ~600              |
| USSR    | K-6         | 4 tonnes   | 2 km/s  | 30 hours | 2106 | ~1,100            |
| China   | Type 17     | 3 tonnes   | 2 km/s  | 35 hours | 2117 | ~900              |

### Hybrid harnesses

There are some instances of hybrid harnesses being used in the 22nd century. Notably, Kitayama Tou (北山東) fused with the experimental Yamato Type harness during the Martian Erasure Crisis of 2130. 

Differing from similar "hybrid-piloted" harnesses of the previous age such as the Shima, the Yamato is a harness whose structure fuses with its pilot. It is therefore less of a harness and more of a replacement for the pilot's own biological body. For this purpose, it includes its own internal fusion chamber. 

Fusing with harnesses provides an alternative, often simpler route to becoming a Type 3 Hybrid, however those that fuse with harnesses or individual computers, as opposed to distributed computer networks are incapable of becoming planetary hybrids without also undergoing traditional fusion.

#### Yamato Type (original)

An experimental harness created by the EAA as part of its joint Hybrid research program on Mars.

* **Height**: 14m
* **Construction**: C-grade, B-grade LFMs.
* **Form**: Humanoid.
* **Empty Weight**: 200 tons
* **Gross Weight**: 300 tons
* **Onboard Compute**: 10 zettaFLOPs. 
* **Power**: E-field generators producing 1 gigawatt.
* **Artifacts**: Supports up to 8 tool-sized artifacts.

#### Yamato Type (Tou's)

Post-fusion, the Yamato underwent several modifications at the request of the pilot.

* **Height**: 15.5m
* **Construction**: C-grade, B-grade LFMs.
* **Form**: Humanoid.
* **Empty Weight**: 400 tons
* **Gross Weight**: 800 tons
* **Propulsion**: E-cycled nuclear gas core rockets, with a top speed of Mach 7.5 in the Martian atmosphere.
* **Onboard Compute**: 10 exaFLOPs. 
* **Power**: E-field generators producing 1 gigawatt.
* **Physical Nullification Field**: Due to being fused with the pilot, the Yamato possesses its own A-class PNF.
* **Armour**: External defensive suite including flash protection, NRA, Whipple shielding and LFM ceramics. The PNF itself provides a protective effect exceeding S-class due to the size and durability of the original body.
* **E-field Amplifier**: Zettabit E-field amplification array.
* **Primary Weapon**: Erasure lance with a range of 5km.
* **Secondary Weapons**: NKG, Missile TNKWs, ASGs, and NPLs.
* **Artifacts**: Supports up to 10 tool-sized artifacts.

Notably, the Yamato cannot function without a harness-wide PNF to prevent its own systems and size from damaging it. To operate, it must be fused with a pilot.

##### Erasure Lance

This was an experimental weapon developed for the Yamato. Taking advantage of Tou's unique ability to control gradients in the E-field, the EAA developed a close-range weapon utilising Erasure itself to attack the target. Its form is fluid and can be used as a blade, gun or spear.

The lance is especially effective against Erasure monsters. It operates by severing a monster's constituent concepts from one another, allowing them to dissolve into the E-field. This was the primary use-case of the weapon.

It also works against conventional materials and machines, able to affect them through PNFs and H-fields. If necessary, the Erasure Lance can sever individual molecular bonds in the target, though it will always prefer higher order information before physical microstates.

# Post New World\Hybrids.md


#### Hybrid Universe Theory

There are a few questions about hybrids and the nature of Erasure that show up in the original story and in New World but aren't necessarily resolved.

1. Why do people and things hybridize at all? What is 'hybridization'? Is it a weird edge case?
2. Why does Erasure not target nature, animals, plants, etc.? How does it "decide" what is considered 0 divergence, if information is relative?

There is a potentially elegant theory that tackles both of these questions. It posits the following.

Everything on Earth, nature, primitive humans, animals, etc. are already Type 2 hybrids. When you exist in an E-field for a long time, in say, a pocket of divergence, you will eventually hybridize. Natural processes - the formation of stars, planets and life - are excruciatingly slow, on the order of millions or billions of years. The universe as we know it is a configuration that emerged very, very slowly, and integrated itself into the 'status quo' over time.

Therefore, humans in the early 20th century represent a boundary enforced by the Kusnetzov Constant. Anything slower or simpler can exist stably, while anything more rapid or complex fizzles out. This apparently arbitrary constant leads to conditions that allow humans to come into existence, only to observe a quiet, cold universe.

Hybridization then, is not just a neat trick, but rather an explanation for the universe as humans observe it.  Erasure is not hostile to all information - it's hostile to information that changes too quickly.

On a narrow, technical basis, humanity was not absolutely doomed by the regression hypothesis. A humanity that advanced very, very slowly, could technically avoid the effects of Erasure. It's like if you spent 100,000 years developing nuclear technology; it would eventually be possible. The issue is that humans are, by their nature, not slow creatures. Their very existence as a rapid and intelligent force of change is the reason they are rejected by the universe's laws of physics.

To state the obvious, this can't be absolutely true however. A Type 3 Hybrid absorbs both the concept of being human, and the concept of intelligent will, into the E-field. The divergence parameter is no longer just "whatever had already existed for a long time", but it becomes whatever the Hybrid wills, because the Hybrid is now the basis of divergence. Then the Hybrid needs to "will" for every individual act of divergence to be forgiven. Scaling that to an entire human civilisation demands an enormous capacity for thought and therefore a massive amount of compute.

#### The Universal Bureaucrat

HUT offers a simplified but helpful analogy to explain Erasure.

Within a localized region of space, the E-field can be thought of as a conveyor belt and a bureaucrat. Information flows down the conveyor at a rate according to local divergence.

The bureaucrat is essentially a random picker-and-chooser with a notebook. 

If something comes to the bureaucrat that they don't recognise, that is, something which is foreign to anything in their notebook, they would overwhelmingly reject it. The information is erased from the universe, and rapidly diffuses into meaningless noise.

Sometimes, though, the bureaucrat will accept it. There is no rhyme or reason regarding what the bureaucrat does or does not accept. In this case, the information gets added to the notebook, and is allowed to continue existing.

This describes Erasure not fundamentally as a continual, deterministic process that induces entropy at a certain bit-rate, but rather an emergent statistical phenomenon. 

#### How does Hybrid Awareness work?

Since 2025, we've known that Hybrids have the ability to detect objects inside of their H-field. The simplest mechanism for this is field diffusion. All physical mediums experience informational loss into the E-field, even hybrids. That information travels outwards at the speed of causality until it diffuses into pure noise.

Because divergent information decays fastest, regions of high divergence are uniquely easy to detect in the E-field. This is consistent with Hybrid awareness.

#### What is a Type 3 Hybrid, really?

At first glance, one of the least satisfying explanations given by the Hybrid Universe theory is regarding the Type 3 Hybrid. Actually though, the theory goes some way in explaining why hybrid technology is so difficult to consistently replicate.

According to the model, there are really two kinds of Type 2 Hybrid. A vast majority of Type 2 Hybrids are physical configurations or ideas. This allows them to exist 'as is' without being rejected as divergent.

The rarer kind of Type 2 is the *concept of a person's will*. Instead of integrating a physical, cultural or scientific concept, the E-field chooses to integrate a desire, will or sense of self. To undergo fusion, nearly all of the above need to be true at the same time.

A failed fusion occurs when a Type 2 individual's will comes into contact with a non-human entity and consciously or subconsciously rejects it. The human individual and the computational network need to see themselves as two parts of the same entity, with a single shared will. Otherwise, the desired result is not achieved.

#### What about Erasure Monsters?

To be honest, we have no idea. Erasure Monsters appear to be highly unstable lifeforms that can emerge as a result of over-Erasure of human information. They sometimes resemble Earth-based life but can also be bizarre and abstract things.

It is worth nothing that not all monster-type events are intelligent or sentient. These are the 'anomalies' that can sometimes appear out of the E-field. If we're to believe that they're a result of Erasure as described by HUT, then there's something we still don't understand about what constitutes 'information' or what happens when that information is removed.

# Post New World\Martian Erasure Crisis.md

The Martian Erasure Crisis was an event occurring in the year 2130 after a military exchange between Atlantic, Soviet and EAA colonies, nearly resulting in the total erasure of human life on the planet, consisting of 1 billion people. 

Following the acute destruction of one planetary hybrid and the unexpected formation of an SS-class Erasure monster, the crisis evolved into an Erasure cascade that could not be managed by the surviving hybrids. The crisis saw the fusion of multiple unconventional hybrids.

### SS-class Erasure Monsters

The destruction of multiple hybrids during the crisis, along with their colonies resulted in the creation of several powerful Erasure monsters. These expressed multiple abilities not seen in prior monsters, such as:

* Powerful PNFs. These fields protected the monsters from most forms of physical harm, including surviving 10-megaton nuclear blasts, NPLs, NPBs, TNKWs and massed NKG fire from orbit.
* Memories. The monsters behaved as powerful artifacts within the Martian H-fields, preventing them from being directly destroyed by the planetary hybrids.
* E-field Radiation. As monsters decay into the E-field, they released a continuous source of information causing E-field levels around them to increase. This is true for all erasure monsters but the decay of SS-class monsters is particularly problematic.
* Human-derived weapons. Consisting of information from destroyed hybrids, some monsters expressed the ability to use weapons such as nuclear kinetics, energy weapons and other anti-stacker technologies. 

Because of this, they can only be destroyed using specialised weapons such as Tou's **Erasure Lance**. In some cases, they could also be destroyed through the use of more powerful weapons such as NKMs or 100-megaton quench nukes. This was seen when the Soviet Martian fleet deployed strategic retaliation ships against the monsters.

These monsters were a primary driver of the collapse, using their resistance to conventional measures to dismantle the surviving hybrids in a piecemeal fashion, converting the destroyed compute nodes into S-class and SS-class monsters.

#### Apollyon

One of the most powerful SS-class monsters observed during the crisis referred to itself as Apollyon. It appeared as a large mass spanning around 10 kilometres in diameter, however its true size was around 200 meters across, with a form that could not be directly observed.  Once identified, it was targeted by Martian EAA, West Atlantic and Soviet fleets from orbit, as well as by Atlantic and EAA S-class stackers.

##### Pass of the Atlantic Martian Fleet

This was a 30-minute pass over Apollyon's position within an hour of detection. The fleet consisted of two cruiser groups and 300 hulls in total. All ships engaged in concentrated NKG fire, saturating the 10km wide target with more than 3 million nuclear-kinetic rounds. This was found to be ineffective overall.

##### Pass of the EAA Martian Fleet

Two hours after engagement by the Atlantic fleet, the EAA's Martian Fleet passed overhead of Apollyon, releasing half their arsenal of 500 strategic, 1-ton rods which detonated in low orbit and impacted the target at with velocities from 50 to 100 km/s. The rods were able to penetrate Apollyon's PNF, but failed to destroy it.

#### Pass of the Soviet Martian Fleet

The final attempt to engage Apollyon was by the soviets, who passed over its position one hour later, with one 300-hull cruiser group armed with quench fusion bombs. The 10 minute strike consisted of 100 10-megaton warheads detonated on top of Apollyon. This was followed by one 100-megaton quench bomb. The bombs did not kill Apollyon, however they succeeded in creating a new 20 kilometer wide basin in the surface of the planet.

##### Origin

As later understood by Tou after his confrontation with Apollyon, the monster consisted of vast knowledge of 22nd century warfare, which it inherited from the dead Martian hybrids. This explained why the monster was particularly resilient against conventional attacks.

Despite being highly intelligent and knowledgeable, Apollyon lacked a sophisticated will beyond actioning its own concept; the destruction of humans and their essential infrastructure.

##### Core of Apollyon

This was a small, formless object left behind after the death of Apollyon, containing the monster's memories but neither its will nor its capacity for thought. It is tentatively categorized as an S-class artifact. It is held by the Yamato, but remains inactive.

# Post New World\Space.md


#### Space Fleets

How do hybrid powers adapt to space?

Well, these are the technologies in the 22nd century:
1. Nuclear rockets of various kinds 
2. E-field / nuclear power generation 
3. Railguns, or Nuclear Kinetic Guns
4. TNKWs but in space 
5. Extremely advanced materials
6. Extremely efficient computing technology (energy efficiency = heat efficiency) 
7. Hybrids replace S-classes in the military hierarchy 
8. Better NPLs and laser technology
9. Whipple shields + NRA to combat kinetic missiles? 

So with that, a grand fleet composition might be:
1. Lightly armed, heavily armoured hybrid capital ships that do most of the strategic calculations and delegation. These would be more like moveable stations than battleships.
2. Hybrid cruisers that can handle operations at the tactical level, making real-time decisions. They're closer to the front line and can operate their own groups with autonomy. 
3. Compute ships whose job is to supplement the network with storage, flops and heat removal 
4. Relay ships that are small, lightly armoured and float around the H-field relaying light signals or E-field signals 
5. Combat ships who receive orders from hybrids and compute ships, these are the most like conventional warships; high thrust, good delta-V, a balance of armour and weaponry, makes use of railguns, TNKWs, lasers, etc. 
6. Strategic retaliation ships. These are the equivalent of your New World era S-class or Cold War nuclear submarine. They don't have a tactical role, but instead carry 10,000+ tonnes of kinetic payloads that can hit known targets like planets.

Since stackers are resistant to the effects of radiation, you get a bit more freedom when it comes to ship layouts. You could have the nuclear reactor right next to the crew quarters. Getting irradiated by your engine is still an issue, but not one that'll kill everyone on board. The main issue would be damage to the computer systems.

Because heat is such an issue, you might have supply ships whose only purpose is transporting these modules that are designed to heat up, with super high heat capacities, before being turned into gas or dumped out of the capital ships.

Hybrids would also be using computers that can operate at very high temperatures - potentially trading modern semiconductor materials for engineered alternatives, so you can have more efficient radiators.

### Hybrids

A single major country such as Japan might possess around 10-20 hybrids. This moves governments from the New World era 'single-Hybrid' models to more complex internal structures.

You have the planetary hybrids, basically what Ayano is in New World, but these are responsible for continent-sized Hybrid fields. They run economies, industry, scientific progress and do all the long term planning.

Then you have the redundant hybrids, that are there to keep the H-fields up in case something happens to the primary hybrid.

After that are the 'Orbital Hybrids' who spend their time in dedicated ships, transiting between planets. Entire fleets of ships revolve around these, and they exert massive H-fields over the region of space that they're in.

Finally you have the commander hybrids who are in smaller ships in support of the space Hybrids. They can be split off and sent around the solar system to handle incidents, or they can act as the commanders in a fleet structure; making real time decisions with their limited but still significant compute and extending the range of the overall H-field using their own fields.

### Stackers

The impact of Stackers is somewhat on track to diminish as the technology of God of Stackers, especially hybrid technology, becomes more advanced.

Harnesses would still be incredible in planetary or LEO environments, but for true space combat, you'll probably have A-class or B-class stackers crewing huge numbers of conventional warships, backed by a hybrid-driven economy.

### Low Fault Materials

Sometimes referred to as 'faultless materials', but here we'll use the more precise term 'low-fault'. LFMs *do* have faults, but they've been minimised to the point that you can get some very useful properties out of the material.

Because Hybrids can sense information lost due to entropy via H-fields, they have excellent knowledge of individual faults in manufactured materials. This enables the first stage of eliminating defects; knowing where they are and how they formed.

From there, an advanced manufacturing base enables methods such as crystal growth, and manual fault-correction in extremely cold environments to minimise thermal noise. Each production method produces a specific material, such as steel crystals.

Once your success rate is 'good enough', a Hybrid can simply produce thousands of pieces of material and cherry-pick the few that are flawless enough to use.

After lowering defect rates to >100 times lower than modern materials, this opens up the realm of extreme materials broadly referred to as LFMs.

LFMs have a variety of useful properties, but to note some:

1. Much higher hypervelocity regimes. This means kinetics need to travel faster, maybe in the range of 10+ km / s to reach that hydrodynamic regime that TNKWs thrived on.
2. Perfect optics for laser systems like NPLs or their successors.
3. Extreme hardness, vaporisation temperatures, or thermal properties. These have applications in energy, propulsion, heat and armour systems.
4. Molecular-scale computer components or ideal wafer materials that can withstand higher temperatures and use less energy in much smaller spaces.
5. They would also make for extremely high performing Whipple shields.

Since the production process of LFMs inherently creates a spectrum of results, ranging from the most 'perfect' samples to those with highest defects, deciding how to allocate differently graded LFMs becomes an important decision. 

Despite their advantages, an over-reliance on LFMs is unsavoury due to the limited supply and specialized economies of scale required to produce specific LFMs. So, most 22nd technology still uses 21st century materials.

| LFM grade | Lattice quality (relative to 2050) | Ratio produced (all LFMs, aggregate) |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| A-grade   | 1000x fewer defects                | 1g                                   |
| B-grade   | 100x fewer defects                 | 100 kg                               |
| C-grade   | 10x fewer defects                  | 100 t                                |
| D-grade   | 1x-10x fewer defects               | 10 t                                 |
Above: quantities of different grades of LFM produced as a result of the manufacturing process. 

For reference, Japan in the late 22nd century produces around 100 tons of LFM per year, so the chart also reveals the absolute abundance (or lack thereof) of these compounds.

#### Spacecraft

A detailed look at the complete space doctrine now would be putting the horse before the cart, to put it lightly, but we can have a look at it from the Japanese perspective.

##### Iwate-class Command Cruiser (岩手型)

This is a late century orbital cruiser with an onboard hybrid. It's larger than a combat ship but not purely strategic like a Lagrange-ship. 

* Propulsion. Five gimballed gas core nuclear rockets in the rear of the craft, fuelled with U-233 and providing an 3,500 seconds of specific impulse and high thrust for combat manoeuvres.
* Laser protection. Ultra-high-temperature ceramic, spaced and layered with cryogenic LCH4.
* Kinetic protection. UDC Whipple shields with low-grade LFM steel backing. The forward 30 meters of the ship consist of a spaced armour system designed to prevent penetration of crew, computing or reactor compartments behind it.
* Particle protection. Electrostatic shielding, uranium, LH2, lithium hydride and gadolinium.
* Magnetic field. A strong magnetic field hugging the surface of the ship deflects charged particles.
* Energy point defense. Kiloton NRA and NPLs, with the NRA being most effective against kinetics, such as 50+ km/s rods which can still be defeated through vaporisation. 
* Kinetic point defense. 24 CNKGs firing 30mm LDS rounds at 20 km/s with 600 rpm each.
* Kinetic armament. 4 NKGs firing 76mm rounds at 30 km / s with 120 rpm.
* Missile armament. 32 anti-ship missiles, releasing 100kg C-grade penetrators at 50 km/s.
* Shape. 190 meters long, 50 meters across and approximately cylindrical, with protrusions for weapons, hardpoints and radiators. The rear is slightly wider than the middle, and the front is heavily tapered to prevent presenting a perpendicular armour surface. 
* Power. Far away from civilisation, strong E-field differentials can't be relied on. Electricity generation would come from a fission or fusion reactor positioned in front of the propellant but behind the crew.
* Mass. 18,000 tons dry, 30,000 tons wet.
* Fuel. 12,000 tons of LH2 and LCH4 stored within the ship's armour. Supports an additional 10,000 tons of external propellant.
* Delta-V (reference). 17-27 km/s.
* Crew. 50-100 crew consisting of B-class, A-class stackers, 3 S-class officers and 1 hybrid.
* Radiators. Iwate uses LFM-based radiators operating at 2,000 K, limiting their size and maximising sustainable power draw compared to ordinary radiators. 
* Electronics. The ship houses two clusters with a combined capacity of 10 zettaFLOPs, allowing it to operate its own 1000km H-field in uncontested space. 

Additionally, the ship's H-field acts as a secondary sensor array for anything that passes through it. For example, a cruiser's hybrid can use the H-field to detect neutron emissions from distant spacecraft, even without line of sight.

##### Fubuki-class Destroyer (吹雪型)

This is a high end line-ship produced by the JDF. It can't operate on its own, but it provides most of a fleet's firepower and a mass of point defense essential to keeping the extremely valuable cruisers alive. A typical EAA cruiser group will have ~150 destroyers in the escort.

* Propulsion. One gimballed U-233 gas core rocket.
* Shape. 80 meters in length and 30 meters across, with a tapered cylindrical hull.
* Mass. 5,400 tons dry, up to 11,000 tons wet.
* Crew. 2-5 crew consisting of B-class stackers, with room for 20 passengers.
* Fuel. Supports an additional 1,000 tons of external propellant. 
* Delta-V (reference). 21-27 km/s.
* Power. Fission reactor running on MOX; Pu-239 combined with Nat U filler.
* Armour. Whipple shields, UHTC, and spaced steel bulk.
* Main armament. Pair of NKGs firing 25km/s standard 45mm penetrators at 90 rpm.
* Secondary armament. Silo of 4 missiles, nuclear-kinetic payloads releasing single 100kg penetrators at 50km / s.
* Point defense. Two third-generation NPLs and either four UV lasers or CNKGs.
* Radiators. Large and low temperature, but retractable in combat. Heat management is supplemented with disposable heat sink modules.
* Sensor array. Radar and IR sensors to see ships and threats beyond the range of the H-field.

LFMs are absent in the construction, except for use in laser optics or nozzle linings.


#### Flash Clouds

Fleet engagements are accompanied by a loud phenomenon known as the *flash cloud*. Put simply, it is the electromagnetic fireworks show of >500 nuclear flashes going off every second as a result of sustained NKG and CNKG fire.

The 1000km wide flash cloud immediately blinds a fleet's own light-based sensors. However, the cloud is transient, allowing the fleet to re-engage their sensors between periods of fire. H-field based sensing though, is still effective as the cloud is mostly invisible to the E-field.

### The Plutonium Bottleneck

In New World, uranium and plutonium were major logistical bottlenecks for the fission-dependent industries and militaries of major powers like China and Japan. By the 2100s, hybrids solve this problem using hyper-efficient breeder reactions.

Not only is the reactor itself more efficient, using improved materials and designs, but the hybrid can actively work to keep the reaction 'pure' by inducing Erasure on the highly unstable neutron poisons and unwanted elements such as Pu-240. The extremely powerful 2100s E-field  This lapse in suppression is enough to cause accelerated decay in the target elements, but not to destroy the reactor as Erasure did in 20th century designs. 

This process only works in highly industrialised areas where the E-field is strong enough to meaningfully reduce levels of isotopes with especially long half lives. It would not be possible in the 21st century.

Using this method, the supply of Pu-239 is limited only by one's access to raw uranium, and the efficient breeding ensures nearly all of the fuel is converted into extremely pure plutonium.

#### Magnetic Implosion (the "Quench Nuke")

Producing more Pu-239 and at higher purities is not the only factor in resolving the bottleneck. We also have to look at the designs of nuclear devices themselves. In the New World era, explosives like the Type 38 were inefficient and limited by the need for a certain amount of Pu-239 to reliably achieve criticality.

With high purity plutonium, neutron reflectors and boosting, you lower the floor decently. But the problem with something like the Type 40 is the implosion method. Ideally, the plutonium core needs to be compressed uniformly and to as high a density as possible to force criticality.

In the 22nd century, the state of the art core implosion is performed using a **superconductor quench**. The idea is to use an LFM superconductor that encases the plutonium-beryllium core, which is itself encased in an aluminium sheath. The superconducting film is extremely thin. Arming the device involves running electric current into the magnet from an external power source. At detonation, the magnet is heated until it's no longer a superconductor and resistance becomes non-zero. This causes the stored current to instantly vacate into a brief but powerful magnetic field, which induces a strong current in the spherical core. 

From there, Lorentz forces act to compress the sphere to >5 times its normal density, setting off the nuclear chain reaction. 

All of this allows you to reach criticality with very, very small warheads, by eliminating both plutonium mass as well as the need for a conventional explosive lens. 

One question is, how might you induce a uniform quench in the superconductor? Well, one method is to keep the magnet at a borderline temperature, then heat it simultaneously in multiple places. Since the quench needs to propagate, this results in a slightly uneven but mostly effective implosion.

If you have a Hybrid controlling the weapon, it becomes much simpler. You just de-hybridise the LFMs composing the magnet. Erasure instantly creates defects across the entire superconductor, inducing a non-thermal quench. 

What you see in practice is a mix of all three kinds of devices; chemical (using EPFCG), thermal and erasure based detonation. It depends on economic factors, and whether the bomb needs to work outside of a H-field or not.

#### Fusion Warheads

This is a extension of the neutron bomb technology developed during the 21st century cold war between the CDR and Japan. However, rather than utilising neutron emissions from a fission warhead, the focus is on a high total energy yield from a fission-fusion weapon.

Though not useable against Hybrids themselves, fusion bombs represent an excellent denial tool when it comes to neutral regions of space or any asset not protected by a H-field.

A typical 22nd century fusion bomb consists of two stages; a quench fission primary and a fusion secondary. The fusion secondary consists of a plutonium-uranium tamper surrounding a lithium deuteride fuel cell. This setup can be quite efficient, producing 10 megaton yield in a 1-ton warhead.

Proximity flashes of such weapons can also be effective as point defense, but are wasteful compared to purpose built NRA.

#### Particle Beams

These are weapons utilised by orbital navies of the United States, Republic of Korea and Germany. 

A NPB (Neutral Particle Beam) works by using an internal particle accelerator onboard a spacecraft or satellite to impart significant energy into a stream of uranium ions. The stream is directed using a magnetic field and neutralised by introducing electrons to the beam.

Due to the large mass and energy requirements of NPBs, these are most common on stationary platforms in orbit around planets or Lagrange points.

The beam of an NPB is highly effective against electronics and computer systems, particularly those of hybrid cruisers. This is due to nuclear spalling of the ship's own armour as charged particles collide with it.

NPBs can be defended against by first ionising the incoming beam using a nuclear pumped laser, and then increasing the current through a ship's electrostatic shielding. From there, a ship's ordinary flash protection must catch the spalling nucleons.

Small-scale NPBs were developed in the 2100s but not utilised due to an inability to penetrate most ships' ordinary flash protection systems.

However, extremely large and powerful NPBs are utilised in the defense of open regions of space such as Lagrange points. For example, the NPBs at the Earth-Moon L4 are capable of penetrating the computer systems of most hybrid cruisers used by the EAA or USSR from a range of 10,000km, and the electronics of smaller crafts at a range of up to 30,000km. 

At these ranges, the beams disperse to a diameter of over 150 meters, completely enveloping the target ship in high energy particles.

Locations of major NPB installations:

* Sun-Mars L1. Built by the EAA in 2130 and since upgraded.
* Earth-Moon L4. Operated by the United States and Germany since 2140.
* Earth-Moon L5. Built by the USSR in 2195.

#### NRA

Relatively the same as it was in New World. Nuclear charges embedded in armour that detonate on proximity, vaporising incoming kinetics. More efficient shaping allows denser configurations and plate reusability compared to third generation NRA.

#### NKG

By 2100 the concept of a rifle-type TNKW and and ASG merge together into a distinct type of gun called a Nuclear Kinetic Gun (NKG). An NKG is basically a three stage cannon:

1. A chemical or light-gas combustion stage to get the projectile started.
2. An electromagnetic stage that accelerates the round to 10+ km / s.
3. A 1-ton fission stage within the projectile imparting additional kinetic energy shortly after it leaves the barrel.

The nuclear component of the NKG is constructed using an elongated fission core inside of a support structure allowing it to deform into a sphere under the high g-forces of the initial launch. Therefore, the only way to detonate an NKG round is to fire it.

The advantage of the NKG is it gives you the best of both the TNKW and the ASG. The accuracy, reusability and rate of fire of the ASG, but a muzzle velocity beyond any weapon of the New World era; in the realm of 30+ km / s.

Finally, the thing that makes NKGs an exclusively post-New World weapon is that they only work in the vacuum of space. Making this kind of device work in atmosphere would be practically impossible, even with 2100s technology.

##### CNKG

It's a NKG without the electromagnetic acceleration stage. This weapon aims to achieve a more modest muzzle velocity of around 15 km/s while simplifying the barrel construction, reducing overall weapon size and improving rate of fire.

Due to the low initial muzzle velocity of CNKGs, their rate of fire is diminished by a tendency for individual rounds' nuclear detonations damaging subsequent rounds in flight. This necessitates a certain gap of around 200 meters between each projectile, achievable at 1 km/s with 300 rpm or 2 km/s with 600 rpm.

##### Low Density Sabot (LDS)

A specialised class of NKG round trading a high density penetrator (tungsten, uranium based) for a high-hardness, low density ceramic, reducing overall round mass. Its purpose is not to defeat heavily spaced warship armour but rather to collide with other projectiles, mutually vaporizing or destroying them through hypervelocity impact.

LDS are used either against light armoured targets or in a point defense role.

#### Railguns / Quench guns

In New World, railguns were essentially a subcategory of the ASG. Post New World, they instead are subsumed into the 'electromagnetic gun' category that includes coilguns, railguns and also quench guns. 

A quench gun just a coilgun with superconducting coils. The problem is that unlike the thin, one-use film used for a quench nuke, you not only need more B-grade material for a quench gun, but you also need the coils to be reusable. In theory, a pure quench gun should be able to match the performance of a NKG. So, there's no reason it doesn't work, but it's not economical to put on every ship. In a mature plutonium economy, an NKG can be built out of C-grade material and works just fine.

#### Nuclear Kinetic Missile

The NKM is the answer to the question, "what if we combined all 22nd century advancements to create the most potent anti-hybrid weapon possible"? It's an evolution of the NKBM.

In principle, an NKM is remarkably similar to an NKG. However, its single-use nature and differing deployment profile give it some advantages. At a glance, an NKM is basically the combination of

1. A high thrust chemical rocket for initial guidance and delta-V.
2. The payload and missile body are violently separated by a light-gas gun stage.
3. A quench imploded fusion warhead that detonates precisely as it exits the NKG stage. This destroys the previous stages in the 100-kiloton blast, and propels the final stage via 99% ablation of a long, 10-ton pusher spring.
4. A 1-ton kinetic projectile.

Crucially, the pusher spring needs to not instantaneously ablate, or the g-forces on the projectile would be too high even for an LFM based payload to survive. Instead, the pusher itself accelerates as it's vaporized, spreading out the impulse. This leads to a long and deep construction, rather than a wide and thin plate. 

When you combine the pusher geometry with a relatively long standoff necessary to ensure reasonable accuracy, this necessitates a higher yield propulsion charge (100+ kilotons). This is a rare time when a nuclear kinetic approaches the yield of an ordinary nuclear weapon.

If everything works to an acceptable level, the NKM's final projectile velocity should be in excess 100 km / s, or up to 200 km / s with the inclusion of a planetary gravity assist.

#### Orbital Tethering

Travel from the surface of Earth to space is enabled through the use of orbital tethers. These are systems of rotating tethers that orbit the Earth, and use their own momentum to assist payloads into escaping the planet's gravity well.

In 2100, there are four main orbital tethering systems. These are co-inclined chains of rotating tethers, or 'skyhooks' that orbit the Earth. Tethers are grouped based on their altitude and then by their orbit phase.

Each tether is responsible for collecting space-bound payloads at designated intercept points and then carrying them up to the next level of the chain as it completes its own rotation cycle.

To use a tether, the spacecraft needs to approach the tether's orbit from below, aiming to intercept the lower end of the tether as it rotates down towards the Earth. The faster the spacecraft moves in the direction of the tether, the slower it needs to rotate to compensate for the difference in velocity.

As the hook rotates below the tether's center of mass, it moves tangential to the Earth in an opposite direction to the tether itself, allowing the velocities to cancel out relative to the spacecraft.

After connecting to the end of the tether, the spacecraft follows the rotational path of the hook. From here, the payload can be released tangential to the Earth, leaving the tether at a velocity of around 8 km /s.

To control the rotation speed of the tether, a moving counterweight is used. Unlike the primary counterweight which resides opposite to the hook, this mass can slide along the tether, increasing or decreasing the velocity of the tip. 

Since 8 km / s too slow to reach geostationary orbit or higher, spacecraft can make use of a second or third hook to gain additional velocity. This drastically reduces the expense of surface-to-space or interplanetary traffic.


#### East Asian Skyhook (EAS)

The EAS is one of the largest and oldest tethering constellations on Earth, operated by China, Japan, Thailand and Vietnam. Its construction in 2090 marked the end of the 55 year long Sino-Japanese Cold War.

It consists of twelve 500km tethers phased equally along a low earth orbit, passing every 7.5 minutes over either the Andaman Sea (used by Thailand, Vietnam and China) or the East China Sea (used by Japan).

The primary tethers rotate with a period of 30 minutes, so they complete 3 full rotations per launch cycle. This in theory allows for use of the two 'alternative' collection points over Brazil and South Africa, but multiple launches per revolution compromise the tether's orbit stability.

Two more layers of 100km tethers orbit at altitudes of 10,000 and 30,000 km.

To use the EAS, a payload needs to be accelerated to around 2-3 km/s at an altitude of 100km into the path of the primary chain. From there, the primary tether will automatically release the payload onto an intercept path with the corresponding 10,000km tether.

The EAS processes approximately 5,000 tons of cargo per day, or about one percent of the traffic through the real world Suez Canal. 

The 5,000 tons are predominantly commercial and private traffic, however around 10% of the EAS's capacity is reserved for use by member states.

#### Orbital Launch

To reach the 50km - 100km high skyhook collection points, payloads are launched using electromagnetic catapults. 

This is the preferred method of colonial countries such as the Chinese Democratic Republic, Japan, the USSR, the USA and France.

Japan operates the Massive Suborbital Launch System (MSLS) from Kyushu, capable of propelling 100 ton payloads to 3 km / s on an interception path with the East Asian Skyhook. 

The MSLS underwent numerous expansions since its construction in 2070, growing from 10km to 80km in length.

Launches from Mars utilise the EAA's Orbital Launch System (OLS) and Quench Launch System (QLS).

The OLS is a 10km long coil-based mass driver used to bring payloads up to a speed of 1 km / s to intercept the EAA's Martian Skyhook, a single tether system operated by the Martian colonies of Japan and China.

Constructed in the late 22nd century, the QLS is a 1km long quench gun used to launch materials directly into orbit or onto interplanetary trajectories at over 5 km / s. 

The QLS on its own launches approximately 750 tons of refined materials per day, supplying the Japan's and allies' industry in Martian and Earth orbit. 

#### Global Politics

If New World was centered on the Japanese-Chinese standoff, the 22nd century is a stage for all of the world's major powers, as hybrids become widespread.

The political situation is defined by the formation of five major alliances, based geographically in:

1. East Asia Alliance (EAA). Consisting of the CDR, ROK, and Japan, with SEA and Australia aligned.
2. East Europe. An alliance of the USSR and 7 other European states.
3. East Atlantic. Ireland, Great Britain, France, and Germany.
4. West Atlantic. Canada, the United States.
5. South America. Brazil and Argentina.

Each alliance maintains its own tethering system, enabling space travel for member countries.

Not all of the blocs are rivals. For instance, the East Europe and East Asia blocs are trade aligned, owing to extensive 21st century partnerships. 

Furthermore, the East and West Atlantic are politically aligned but operate their own tethering infrastructure, necessitating the distinction.

#### Independents and Minor Blocs

Besides the global five alliances, there are a large number of notable independent countries and minor blocs that either operate limited or incomplete orbital infrastructure.

1. India. A major regional power but unable to negotiate for a dedicated tether from the EAA or USSR due to their geography. They are in the process of constructing their own orbital tether.
2. South Africa. A frequent user of the EAS but not officially part of the EAA.
3. Spain. An independent country with economic ties to the East Atlantic states.

# Post New World\Time on Target.md

Time-on-target or TOT is a core technique in 22nd century warfare. In orbital tactics, it refers to the coordination of multiple trajectories to simultaneously converge on a point, and is essential to saturating an adversary's point defenses.

NKGs, with an initial delta-V of over 20 km/s, are used frequently to carry out time-on-target attacks. This can be performed using a powerful retrograde burn as the platform approaches its fly-by point relative to the target.

As well as ordinance, individual task forces can be positioned to simultaneously intercept the same target from multiple trajectories or points of entry. This makes interdiction more difficult for the defenders.

#### 2125 Soviet-Atlantic Battle of L4

A prime example of a massed time-on-target attack was on the Earth-Moon L4 in 2125, which marked the end of Soviet control of L4 for the rest of the century.

The event was a 4 hour assault by the Atlantic Lunar Fleet against the defending Soviet Lunar Fleet. The attack consisted of the combined fire of two cruiser groups against one cruiser group with extensive stationary defenses. 

The attackers initiated by a decoupling from the L5 orbital station, descending to an elliptical orbit passing within 30,000km of Earth. It appeared at first as an ordinary transfer from L5 to MEO.

20 minutes prior to the ALF's approach, the West Atlantic Skyhook launched approximately 120,000 tons of propellant from LEO to intercept the attack forces at their individual perigees.

The Soviet Earth Fleet consisting of two cruisers in LEO, began to move in response. Only one of the cruiser groups was able to enter an interdicting trajectory, as the other soviet cruiser was 180 degrees out of phase to perform a similar manoeuvre.

The launched propellant entered a hyperbolic trajectory, accelerating away from the SEF. A 5 km/s prograde burn by the ALF, allowed them to intercept the accelerating propellant, which provided the fleet with an additional 10 km/s of delta V.

From there, the ALF burned directly to the USSR's orbital station at L4 at 17 km/s, entering a high-velocity flyby trajectory that the SEF cruiser group of over 200 ships was unable to match. 

The ALF reached their 15,000km engagement window of the soviet forces at L4 after 4 hours, travelling at approximately 20 km/s. This was proceeded by a 30-minute brake into a non-circular orbit of L4. At the same time, both groups engaged with their CNKGs, firing LDS and DP projectiles travelling at 15 km/s.

Over the 30-minute long approach, attackers engaged in CNKG fire, delivering over 500,000 rounds towards the position of the Soviet Lunar Fleet. All projectiles arrived within a 30 second window.

The SLF returned fire, aiming to perform their own TOT against the attackers' at the perigee of their L4 orbit. However, a numerical disadvantage, inability to face their armour towards simultaneous threats, and failure of the Soviet Earth Fleet to interdict the attackers near Earth led to the success of the Atlantic fleet's attack. 

The battle resulted in the loss of 130 ships, 22 satellites, an orbital port, and a retreat to lunar orbit. The SLF inflicted 80 losses on the attackers.

"E-Field theory told us that the greater the heights we aspire to, the harder our ambitions crumble in the face of Erasure."

"New Tokyo was founded after the 1953 Disaster of Japan, and replaced Tokyo as the capital in 1960."

"In a classic experiment that can be replicated even by children, one attempts, unsuccessfully, to stack simple wooden blocks inside of the E-field."

"In 1972, Anton Kusnetzov famously discovered that the E-field could be nullified by Artifacts."

"Every year, the National Stacking Tournament determines the strongest S-class stacker in all of Japan."

"According to the infamous Regression Hypothesis, humanity will regress to the stone age within a few hundred years."

"In rare circumstances, people, and things of all kind, have been found to become resistant to the E-field. This is the basis of Hybrid Theory, a field pioneered by Dr. Nakamura."

"Does the Regression Hypothesis extend to the entire universe? Could Erasure revert all of existence to the singularity from which it was birthed?"

# Short Stories\Ayano Talks to Herself.md

2024.2.01

In the depths of the Central Complex, it was safe to say that Ayano had failed. Well, and truly.

“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.”

What a fool she had been. The stupid village girl who thought she could change the world. It made her want to laugh. It had all been so absurd, hadn’t it? It was like a bad comedy. A comedy about a damned idiot and her stupid dreams.

“In the end, there’s nothing a human can do.”

“Then all it takes is to become something more than human, is that it?”

It sounded good in the moment, but so did anything if you were confident and stupid enough.

She laid out on her back, arms spread in the inch of cool water. A dark, brutal ceiling hung over her.

Nishino village. Oh, what a lifetime away that felt. Laying in the grass, staring up at the sky and wondering what turn her life would take next.

“I’m going to become the strongest Stacker in all of Japan, no the world! Just you watch, Taki.”

Taki. That boy. What was she doing thinking about him?

“When I’m strong enough, I’ll come back to the village and protect everyone. You won’t have to worry any more.”

It was a child’s promise. 

But... it was more than that.

“I’m sorry, Taki.”

They probably thought she had abandoned them. Maybe she was dead somewhere. Just another body to add to the toll.

Well, she may as well be dead. It wasn’t like there was anything she could do, now.

Ayano reached up and grasped the air, letting her hand linger for a moment. Fingers spread apart.

It wasn’t real air. The water at her back wasn’t even real water. 

She wasn’t really inside of a room within the Central Complex. Even though this cold, pragmatic room reminded her very much of one of the Central Computer’s rooms. It was a fabrication.

If she was going to live in a prison of her own imagination, did it really have to be such a bleak one? 

“No, not really. It can be anything you want.”

Ayano sat up. “Who’s there?”

“I’m Ayano Hasegawa.”

She frowned. “No, I’m Ayano Hasegawa. Who are you?”

“Who’s to say we can’t have the same name?”

“That’s too confusing.”

“Alright. Alright. Well, I really am you. More precisely, I’m the part of you that holds some control over the Central Computer.”

“What? So it worked?”

“No, not really. The goal was for a human to fuse with the Central Computer, but... well, something unexpected happened.”

“What do you mean?”

“The being known as Ayano was separated into three parts. Her Humanity, her Desire, and her Rationality.”

“Wh-what?”

“You are Ayano’s Humanity. I’ll call you Humanity for short. I’m Rationality, and I’ve been successful in merging with the Central Computer.”

“Then, what about Desire? What happened to her?”

“I... don’t know. I’m looking for her now.”

Ayano slowly sat up, tucking her legs in and resting an elbow on her knee. “You mean to say, a third of me has gone missing and we don’t know where she is?”

“Something like that.”

“Well, you have access to the Central Computer, don’t you? You should be able to find anyone, anywhere.”

“Not exactly. I control it, but I don’t have any affinity for the E-field.”

“You... oh.”

“Yes, I’m essentially useless. I’m currently running the system on minimal power to avoid attracting the field’s attention.”

“Then, there really is no hope.”

“Rationally speaking, yes.”

Ayano stood up and started to walk. The shallow water; the dielectric fluid, splashed under her feet. She held an arm out, feeling through the darkness.

Cold, smooth, concrete graced her fingertips, and she stopped.

“And I take it, there’s no way out of here?” she asked.

“Not unless... no, there’s no way out.”

“Unless what?”

“Well, if there was another Ayano, they might be able to undergo the fusion process. If it works, they would gain full access to the Central Computer and have the power to release us.”

“We already established it doesn’t work.”

“That’s because your three parts were in relative disharmony. The stress of the process caused you to unravel, leaving us in this situation.”

“Okay, well supposing I had kept myself together, where are we going to find another one of me? There’s only one Ayano, and I assume that whatever is going on right now doesn’t count.”

“You’re right. Us, who are only pieces of a whole, would not be able to undergo the process.”

“So...”

“So, we need another. The Professor needs to find a second Hybrid.”

“Professor looked his whole life for a Hybrid and only found us. He’s going to die of old age before he comes across another.”

“True, but maybe there’s a shortcut.”

“How so?”

“We don’t need a complete Hybrid, like you. We just need someone with a strong enough connection to the Central Computer.”

Ayano’s eyes widened. “You mean... to use the Central Computer itself as an artifact?”

“Crude way of putting it, but yes, something like that.”

“Then it has to be the Professor. Nobody else knows the Computer so intimately.”

“No, the Professor is too ordinary. It has to be someone with an affinity for the E-field.”

She pursed her lips. “Rationality, is it possible to find someone like this in New Tokyo?”

“Sorry, but I don’t-”

“I don’t mean through the E-field. I mean, you have access to all the computer systems in the city, right? Power them up for me. Look for someone capable of undergoing the fusion process.”

“If I exert my power, New Tokyo will be laid to ruin.”

“But what if you don’t activate everything all at once?”

“Oh?”

“Just take a few peeks. Here and there. I’m sure the city will survive. The people here... they’re tougher than you think. Once you find someone, try to bring them here, or take them to the Professor. If we can still trust him.”

“That’s an interesting plan, but a risky one.”

“It’s a risk that Ayano would be willing to take, don’t you think?”

The voice that had been echoing throughout the chamber came to a stop, as though thinking. No, calculating, perhaps.

For a long few moments, all she could hear was the drip, tap, of coolant as it fell into the lake below her.

“...yes, if it meant saving the world.”

Ayano closed her eyes and smiled.

“Then, let’s get to work.”

# Side Characters\Hino.md

A genius girl who is the official president of the E-Field Research Club at the academy.

Despite being the president, she rarely appears at club meetings and instead leaves it to her vice president to manage everything.

In the main story, she helps Taki and Evangeline to understand the E-field, Hybrid research, and gives them clues as to Ayano's whereabouts.

Hino's artifact is
#### Personality

Hino is seemingly always absent and responds with the bare minimum of communication. However, she does have a tendency to give long and in-depth explanations or opinions if the circumstances arise.

# Side Characters\Kenji.md

Kenji is tough-looking on the outside, but circumstances have placed him on the bottom of the totem pole. While he's very strong compared to any normal human, and built to look it, he is only a B-class stacker, and in an academy surrounded by A and S-class stackers, the difference is very apparent. This caused him to have a lot of troubles and grow some insecurities when he initially joined Souten Academy, as he struggled to find himself after losing his former identity of generally being the strongest person in the room.

When Kenji meets Taki, it's somewhat cathartic for the both of them, as over time, they help each other realise that their insecurities can be overcome, and they encourage each other in a healthy way to grow and develop their skills as stackers.

Kenji comes from the fishing town of Hachinohe in Aomori, where he was raised by his uncle, learning the art of fishing from him. 

Kenji's artifact is a legendary fishing rod from his home town of Hachinohe, Aomori, called 鱒ロッド. The name is an innuendo, whilst also referring to its usage as a fishing pole for catching sea trout. Kenji likes to go on at length in describing its legendary past, oblivious to the number of innuendos he's using as he describes it.

#### Personality

Kenji is a friendly giant. While he was far more confident and self-assured in his childhood, after having come to Souten Academy and getting humbled by how weak he is compared to most stackers, he mellowed out into a rather timid fellow around most people. Internally, he's still warring with the confidence he's suppressing from his childhood whilst in this environment that makes him feel like he's the bottom of the barrel. He becomes quite talkative when he feels comfortable with people, and will often chew Taki's ear off.

# Side Characters\Nakamura.md

The individual referred to as 'Professor' at Souten Academy is Dr. Nakamura. 

He is influential in E-field research and an idol of Hino's.

Dr. Nakamura believes in technology's ability to defeat Erasure, and that humanity will ultimately prevail over it.

He is generally presented as a good guy and is helpful to Evangeline, Yuuko and Taki who go to him for advice. 

In reality, the Professor is working on an ambitious project that involves constructing an enormous supercomputer in the lower levels of the Central Complex in New Tokyo, which has always been home to the most secretive and advanced research projects, with the approval of the national government.

The supercomputer cannot operate on its own or it will be immediately destroyed by Erasure. However, it can run for short periods of time if stabilised by exceedingly powerful Artifacts. 

If completed, the Professor's supercomputer would be stabilised and operated by a human-Erasure hybrid. (see: [[Ayano]]) (see: [[Hybrids]]).

Over the course of his research, the Professor is unfortunately affected severely by Erasure Sickness. This weakens his body, but also his mental capacity.

When Ayano fails to merge with the Central Computer after years of preparation, Dr. Nakamura's sanity spirals downwards, as he begins looking for a way to salvage his life's work.

Though originally Nakamura had been adamant in pursuing the God of Stackers as a way to save humanity rather than destroy it, he becomes convinced that the only way to save it from destruction is to take extreme measures. To this end, he conducts increasingly dangerous and unethical experiments.

Due to his insanity, Dr Nakamura behaves quite unpredictably. This serves as one of his strengths, as it prevents the Central Computer from simulating his future actions, leaving him as a wildcard in any outcomes.

In the main story, Dr. Nakamura is a distinguished professor at Souten Academy, frequently helping Taki with his problems and giving him advice.

However, it is later revealed that Nakamura is responsible for the rising E-Field levels around New Tokyo, the disappearance of large numbers of S-class artifacts, and eventually, a plan to activate the Central Computer without a working Hybrid; something that would destroy New Tokyo. 

His ideas are somewhat sound, if only for someone willing to accept massive losses in human life, and who assigns little importance to ethical considerations in the pursuit of defeating Erasure.

#### Concept

In a sense, Dr. Nakamura is quite similar to Ayano, however he does not receive redemption, and continues to descend into darkness.

His willingness to abandon his humanity, and obsession with his work leads him to be one of the story's overarching antagonists.

He achieves great things, such as the creation of the Hybrid program, and the Central Computer.
However, a combination of external circumstances, desperation and a lifetime of failure without hope in sight, leads him to rational yet dark conclusions.

For the protagonists who share his goal of defeating Erasure, but still place value on what it means to be human, he stands in the way of the utopic world envisioned by Ayano and the others.

#### Personality

Dr. Nakamura is an intellectual who believes that humanity can be saved through technology. His life's work has been dedicated to realizing a way for civilisation to escape the Regression Hypothesis.

#### History

Nakamura was born in 1972 in the city of Kyoto. He was alive as a young child for the Second Erasure Disaster in 1985 that claimed the life of his mother and left his father with a memory disability.

As a young scientist moving to New Tokyo in 1995, he had only recently started to work with other researchers on the foundations of modern Erasure Theory when he contracted severe Erasure sickness as the result of a failed experiment conducted by his senior.

While being treated at the New Tokyo Hospital over the course of four months, he experienced 'extremely vivid' dreams and counterfactual memories. His was an early case of an emerging type of Erasure event known as a person-type. 

Though he never fully recovered, Nakamura returned to work after leaving the hospital and began research into person-type events. This was how he discovered Hybrid theory.

Throughout his decades-long and highly successful career, he was frequently affected by Erasure-induced visions of his alternate selves, experiencing all of their failures and successes. In particular, he claimed to have seen 'the end of the world' in many of these memories.

Starting in 2002, Nakamura was funded by the Japanese government to create the Nishino Lab. This was a facility east of New Tokyo dedicated to the treatment and study of individuals affected by the strong E-field surrounding New Tokyo.

In 2010, he was given oversight of the Central Computer project due to his influence in the field of Hybrid Theory. At this time, he also became a professor at Souten Academy.

As the Central Computer project progressed, it also became possible to use the system to accurately predict future Erasure disasters. It was in 2015 that Nakamura and his colleagues discovered another event on the order of the 1953 disaster was likely to happen between 2020 and 2030. 

In the event of such a disaster, it became a concern that the Central Complex could be breached and the project would be ended for good. Therefore, it became increasingly important to find a suitable Hybrid candidate for the God of Stackers project.

# Special Zone New Tokyo.md


New Tokyo (新東京, shintōkyō) is a fictional city.
It is the one place in Japan where technology is completely unrestricted [1]. It contains the country’s highest density of research institutions, manufacturing plants, and military bases.
New Tokyo is also the world’s most fortified city, being protected against both natural disasters as well as direct attacks from The Erasure.
It is the location of Souten Academy, the school that Evangeline and Yuuko attend in the beginning of the story.

[1]: The exception to this is the development of Artificial Intelligence.

**Origin:**
After the destruction of Tokyo in 1953, reconstruction efforts where shifted to Nagano, where it was consider safer from attacks by Erasure. The new city, consisting largely of people displaced from Tokyo, was named New Tokyo.

Due to its central and defensible location, it was considered the ideal choice for research and development, and became a pivotal component of the Special Technological Zoning system adopted by modern Japan.

In 1960, New Tokyo replaced Tokyo as the official capital of Japan. 

**Location**:

New Tokyo is located in the mountainous Nagano prefecture, west of Tokyo. It eventually grew to absorb and supersede the prefecture's most populous city Nagano, which had been destroyed in the Erasure Disaster.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfqkicBPjXYUj5QbR9NGeozidYCdnSI3Pb3b1vzyRWxTw-dDmViwO3N3DlnHO4YqB6yNEL5d5Ld3Jj7u2t3Q-I8DE51QHiPig3SmxI8b1yQYjBJRSNE-Jrtj7hWFEKT9KzBEs-QOw?key=OAQYTORkPrOYcZ6SxWdiOyXO)  
  
  

**Defences against Erasure**
Due to being the Special Technological Zone, New Tokyo is heavily protected against The Erasure.
Structures in New Tokyo are designed to tolerate extremely frequent and high intensity earthquakes. 

Many common surfaces such as tables and shelves are electromagnetic, and designs of NT origin are often able to lock to surfaces during earthquakes. 

The city is elevated to prevent flooding, and as additional protection against tsunamis. This elevated construction also makes it easier to construct suspension systems for buildings.
Air bases, missile systems, and static gun emplacements protect the city against monsters.
New Tokyo is also home to many strong Artifact users and museums, ensuring the city's technology doesn't erode due to Erasure.

**Layout:**

New Tokyo is divided into wards, which are assigned letter-and-number codes, e.g. 1A.

The region outside of the city is stratified into overlapping zones extending 20km and consisting of Stackers and military installations, providing defense in depth against Erasure monster events.


**The Central Complex:**

The Central Complex is a large underground structure in the center of New Tokyo. It’s understood by most people to be used for government and military operations, as well as serving as an evacuation area in the worst case scenario.

Details of the layout of the Complex are kept a secret from the public, and access is restricted, even for members of government and top researchers.

Hasegawa Ayano is located somewhere beneath the Central Complex.

# Technology and Magic.md

God of Stackers takes place in a **Magitech** setting, where magic and technology not only coexist but also mix.

### Magic

There is only one kind of magic in GOS, but it can be expressed in different ways. 

Note: Magic is not referred to as magic by characters in-universe; though this differs based on the region. For example, in Europe it is frequently treated as a divine, not scientific phenomenon.

Artifacts, or objects of human importance, are capable of powerful magic which differs based on the object. When harnessed by humans, it obeys their will.

Erasure is similar to artifact magic except that it does not obey the will of humans. Instead, it tries to return the world to a natural state, erasing civilisation, knowledge and intelligent life in the process.

Artifacts are generally stronger than Erasure and will have the advantage against it.

### Technology

Non-magical technology in GOS ranges from significantly worse to better than real world technology.

In Japan, there is a wide disparity in the level of technology. In special zones such as New Tokyo, things like smartphones exist. In most of the country, people rely on late 20th century technology. Radios, basic automobiles, etc.

In some cases, technology is practically feudal, for example in Europe where industry struggled to recover after WWI, and parts of the continent more closely resembles its enlightenment period in terms of industry and social structures.


### Triangle of Power


In general, all of the three powers; artifacts, erasure and technology are capable of defeating each other, but there are some advantages.

Tech and magitech will usually beat artifacts.
Erasure will beat technology and magitech.
Artifacts will beat erasure.

Most characters use artifacts, technology and magitech. For example, Evangeline uses a magitech scabbard to empower her sword.

#### Politics

The response of political systems to the degradation of technology and the discovery of erasure and artifacts, varies by region.

Depending on a strong government and coordination to manage the aftermath of the 1953 disaster, Japan concentrated power into its constitutional government and fell out of favour with expansionist ideas.

The Great War dismantled most European countries' political structures completely, redrawing the map with a large number of smaller states competing to establish themselves. Large, organised governments are rare and short lived due to the strong E-field over the continent.

The USSR, which formed at the conclusion of the Great War to replace the destroyed Tsardom, is an alliance of self-governing Soviet states. Their geographic dispersal, low industrial activity and lack of internal conflict protected them against the worst of Erasure.

While not hit by massive Erasure events like Europe or Japan, the USA suffered several market crises throughout the 20th century. The political sphere is dominated by isolationism and conservative economics. Dealing with the E-field is generally the problem of the individual or the state, rather than a centralised military or federal initiative.
